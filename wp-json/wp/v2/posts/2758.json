    "rendered": "<p>Are you thinking about building a deck? Adding or renovating your property\u2019s deck is a great way to add value and beauty to your property\u2014 but like every building project, there are some things you need to know before you start. Depending on where you live, your budget, and your personal tastes, your decking material options might differ from others&#8217;. Each decking material comes with its own maintenance requirements, aesthetic appeal, cost, and other important factors to keep in mind when choosing what&#8217;s right for you and your home.</p>\n<h2>Introducing Trex Composite Decking</h2>\n<p>One of the most popular types of decking in 2021 is Trex. If you\u2019re in the building materials industry world, you\u2019ve probably heard the debate between Trex and wood. Trex decking is a great alternative to wood decking, especially since it looks exactly like wood.</p>\n<p>Although it looks like wood, composite decking is a durable composite material that is made from plastic, wood fibers, and a bonding agent\u2014 all recycled materials, which is a popular trend in today\u2019s environmentally conscious society. Trex is greener and more durable\u2014what more could you want for your deck?</p>\n<h2>Why Trex?</h2>\n<p>When picking out any building material, there\u2019s always four factors to consider: cost, maintenance, eco-friendliness, and of course, look and aesthetics. There are many advantages to using composite decking over wood decking.</p>\n<h3>Cost</h3>\n<p>In general, Trex decking is typically a bigger investment than wood decking. As we mentioned earlier, Trex is a more durable material, which means it lasts longer than wood. With wood decking, you\u2019ll be replacing warped and damaged woods\u2014we know how the weather gets in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Although composite decking is a bigger investment, you\u2019ll be saving money in the long run.</p>\n<h3>Maintenance</h3>\n<p>Not all decking materials are made the same, and not all of them have the same durability. The goal is to get a finished product that will last for years, but that\u2019s not the reality for most decks. Wood decking requires more maintenance than Trex for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Weather</strong>. As we mentioned above, living in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> comes with a lot of weather and harsh elements\u2014you\u2019ll have to replace warped or damaged boards and frequently paint and reseal wood.</li>\n<li><strong>Critters</strong>. Unwanted critters, especially termites, are a common problem with wood decking. There\u2019s no proven way to stop them from feasting on your deck, which will add up to constant repairs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Eco-Conscious</h3>\n<p>Trex decking is made from 95% recycled materials, making it the ultimate choice for an environmentally-sound conscious. These materials include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Grocery and bakery bags,</li>\n<li>Newspaper and produce bags,</li>\n<li>Toilet paper packaging and paper towel packaging,</li>\n<li>Water bottle packaging,</li>\n<li>Dry cleaning plastic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You name it, Trex recycles it into decking! It is possible to find reclaimed wood for your decking project, but most wood decking is made from timber harvested from forests. If you\u2019re looking to lessen your carbon footprint, Trex is definitely the greener choice.</p>\n<h3>Look &amp; Aesthetics</h3>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, always consider the overall look and aesthetics of your deck\u2014not only should your deck look nice, but it also should match the home it\u2019s attached to. When using wood decking, you must look at color and grain, which are more limited in options than that of Trex decking.</p>\n<p>When you choose Trex decking you, you immediately have a bigger variety of colors to choose from, making it much easier to match your vision for your newly renovated home. You also will avoid stains and fading, which a common problem with wood decking.</p>\n<h2>Interested in Using Trex Decking?
