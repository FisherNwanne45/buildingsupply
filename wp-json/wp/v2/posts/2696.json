Spend the summer in style by making sure your deck is up to date with the latest trends. If you\u2019re looking to </span><a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/6-deck-design-trends-to-try-this-summer/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">revamp your deck</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, here are some tips to help you make your deck the best it can be.</span></p>\n<p><b>Go for an Industrial Look</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A modern, industrial style is quickly gaining popularity over traditional rustic designs. Cable or glass railings can provide an unobstructed view of the landscape beyond your deck, with the added bonus of not requiring much maintenance. For flooring, use composite deck boards with sleek and sophisticated lines to create a simple yet elegant look. These lines don\u2019t have to move in the same direction\u2014get creative by laying out some boards diagonally or perpendicular to each other.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stamped concrete is another versatile great way to get an industrial look. It can be used for the deck floor or support pillars, and it comes in many colors. Neutral tones such as earthy browns, muted grays, and cooler blues are the current trending colors, but you should choose whatever colors work best for you.</span></p>\n<p><b>Set up a Covered Area</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Transform your deck into an extension of your living room with this trend that blends practicality with style. A covered area provides ample shade, so you can spend time outside even in the heat of a summer afternoon. You can add a latticework enclosure for greater privacy while still being able to enjoy the view. If you\u2019re going for a more natural look, fast-growing vines can also provide privacy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covered areas come in different sizes and shapes. The arbor is the smallest option. It has two to four posts and an open slatted roof. A pergola traditionally has four posts and an open roof that can be covered by fabric, offering flexibility with how covered the deck is. A gazebo offers the most room and privacy and comes in a variety of shapes, typically hexagonal or octagonal. Finally, the attached overhead is a roof that connects to the back wall of your house and is supported on the deck by strong pillars. The type of covered area you choose depends on your preferences and what fits best with your deck.</span></p>\n<p><b>Include an Outdoor Television</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend started last year and is still going strong. With an outdoor TV, you can experience the best of both worlds\u2014relaxing with a good show and enjoying the great outdoors at the same time. An outdoor TV allows you to transform your deck into a second family room.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you followed the previous tip and added a covered area, you can feel comfortable placing your TV outside without concern about rain damage. For extra protection, you can invest in a waterproof TV that can survive wind, rain, and even snow. Either way, you don\u2019t want to miss out on the chance to host outdoor gaming or movie nights with your friends and family.</span></p>\n<p><b>Make Use of Underdeck Spaces</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have a raised deck, this trend is perfect for you. Underdeck spaces have been undervalued for years, with people using them mainly for storage. Now, people are realizing the untapped potential of this space. It\u2019s essentially a built-in covered area with plenty of room for furniture. Add outdoor couches for comfort or a table for having snacks, and you\u2019ll turn your underdeck space into one of the most relaxing parts of the house.</span></p>\n<p><b>Play with Lighting</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lighting is essential to enjoying your deck at night. In addition to helping you see in the darkness, the type of lighting you choose can set the atmosphere of your deck and create ambience. You can have illuminated risers if your deck is made of multiple levels. If your deck has a small fountain or pond, you can put small lights in the water to create a magical glowing effect. You can even hang up a simple string of lights for an exceptionally cozy look. There are countless opportunities here, and it really depends on the mood you\u2019re going for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are a few of this summer\u2019s biggest deck design trends. By following these tips, you can transform your deck into the perfect backyard retreat.</span></p>\n",
