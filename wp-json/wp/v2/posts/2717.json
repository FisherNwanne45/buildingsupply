    "rendered": "<p>If you are a condo owner in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, you may be thinking about renovations to make to your home. Fall is a great time to get some additions or remodeling done on your condo. As the days start getting shorter, you\u2019ll want to make your condo as cozy and functional as possible in preparation for long winter nights. Here are a few <a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/top-boston-renovation-projects-for-fall/\">fall projects </a>you should consider for your <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo this fall.<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Change the Wall Colors</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been living in your condo for a while, you might be tired of seeing the same walls every day. Try repainting your walls with a different color of paint or replacing the wallpaper with something fresh. To make your rooms feel cheerful and welcoming, go for colors that are bright but not too bold. You don\u2019t even need a professional\u2014repainting is simple enough to do on your own. Although it\u2019s time consuming, it can serve as a fun project for the weekends.<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Weatherstrip Your Doors</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Recently, people have been investing in climate-proofing their homes to protect against extreme weather patterns. Weatherstripping your doors is especially important to keep your condo warm during those cold <?php echo $row['country']; ?> winters, and it also leads to savings on your energy bill.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of options when it comes to weatherstripping materials, each with different advantages and drawbacks. For example, rubber is the most durable, but it is also expensive and challenging to install. Weatherstripping is a simple process. Simply cut the weatherstrip into three pieces\u2014two for the sides and one for the top\u2014and stick them into place. Finish the project by adding a door sweep for the bottom of the door. Like repainting, this is another project you can do yourself.<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Upgrade Your Bathroom Tiles</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In a condo, you may not be able to move around bathroom fixtures without draining your wallet. Luckily, there are less expensive ways you can elevate your bathroom to the next level. You can update the tile and flooring for a fresh look. Small, textured tiles for your shower floor are a must-have. Not only do they look elegant, but the extra grouting and the texture help prevent slips caused by wet and soapy floors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Add Recessed Cabinets for Effective Use of Space</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><?php echo $row['country']; ?> condos can be small, so it is important to get the most out of your space. You can add a recessed medicine cabinet to your bathroom to take up less space while giving you a good amount of storage. These can be labor-intensive to install, but they offer an elegant look to your bathroom and go well with any bathroom design, whether it\u2019s traditional or modern.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Maximize Your Kitchen Storage</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The kitchen has one of the biggest storage requirements of all the rooms in your condo. Even if your kitchen is small, there are ways to make the most of wasted space. If your condo has a banquette, install drawers or shelves below the seating to maximize your use of floor space. For your kitchen cabinets, use soft-closing full extension drawers or increase cabinet sizes to reduce unused wall space.</p>\n<p>You can also add toe-kick drawers. The toe-kick is the space between the bottom of your lower cabinets and the floor, and it is there for ergonomic reasons. By adding toe-kick drawers, you create more space while maintaining the ergonomics of your kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Add Technology to Your Bathroom</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also turn your bathroom into a<a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/take-your-boston-bathroom-to-new-heights/\"> technological hub</a>. No more straining to hear your phone over the water\u2014add a water-resistant speaker to listen to music while you shower. Installing a waterproof TV into your bathroom wall can help you unwind after a long day with a hot bath and good show. Finally, you can install LED lights in your shower or tub. These cycle through different colors, creating a fun and calming atmosphere.<b></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>&nbsp;Install Energy Efficient Windows</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-window-replacement-questions-to-ask-for-your-historic-renovation/\">Window replacements</a>, both wood and vinyl, made the list among the top ten best upscale improvements that you can make. Once you\u2019ve seen all of the new advancements in energy efficient window technology, such as better window coatings and glazes, lower air leakage rates, and more, you won\u2019t be surprised by this improvement\u2019s high ranking.</p>\n<h3><b>8. Upgrade the Lighting</b></h3>\n<p>The days are getting shorter, which means that you\u2019ll get a lot of mileage out of new lighting. Today, buyers and owners alike are looking for bright, even lighting \u2014 although you can always install dimmer switches in key areas like the living room or bedrooms. Recessed lighting will make up the bulk of your new design, but don\u2019t hesitate to add in a chandelier here or there as a statement piece.</p>\n<p>This remodel is one that will certainly require a permit to complete. Of course, if any of the other <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo renovation ideas that we have mentioned end up as extensive renovations, then you may need a permit for those as well, but for the windows, it is a certainty. You may want to check out our <a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/want-to-step-up-your-home-improvement-contractor-relationship-read-this-first/\">post about contractor relationships</a>, where we discuss the types of relationships you can have, and the contractor\u2019s responsibility, which includes obtaining the necessary permits.</p>\n<p>Get started with any of these ideas to improve the look and function of your condo. If you are planning to sell your property in the future, these renovations can also make your condo more attractive to potential buyers. With these upgrades, you\u2019ll look forward to spending comfortable fall and winter days in your home.</p>\n",
