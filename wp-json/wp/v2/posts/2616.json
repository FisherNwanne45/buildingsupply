Many are becoming more aware of just how <a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/the-circular-economy-and-its-impact-on-construction/\">environmentally unfriendly building materials</a> like drywall can be. In fact, when it comes to CO2 emissions, 52% of the world\u2019s total comes from buildings\u2014the energy they use, and the emissions created when the building supplies that go into them are manufactured.</p>\n<p>Drywall in particular is the most popular form of interior wallboard, and its manufacturing requires a lot of energy\u2014which means a lot of CO2 emissions. That\u2019s why some homeowners are now looking for eco friendly drywall options. Let\u2019s take a look at a few of the options available so that you know what to recommend when homeowners, buyers or developers start asking about green wallboard!</p>\n<h3><strong>MgO Board as an Alternative</strong></h3>\n<p>MgO board is a rising star among eco friendly drywall alternatives. Companies like ExtremeGreen produce this unique product, which comes with a lot of benefits. On the environmental side of things, this type of wallboard uses on average 50% less energy during the manufacturing process than drywall production. It\u2019s also a recyclable product, and it\u2019s one that can be composted to use as plant nutrients, too. Plus, it\u2019s made up of non-toxic ingredients, which means that even if it does end up in a landfill someday, it won\u2019t leech harmful chemicals into soil and water supplies.</p>\n<p>When it comes to building concerns, MgO board is sturdy, making it resistant to impacts, scratches, and dents, which means it\u2019s ideal in high-traffic locations. It\u2019s also Class A1 fire rated so that it will fit with whatever local building codes require. To learn more about it, check out <a href=\"https://extremegreenbp.com/products/#wallboard\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://extremegreenbp.com/products/#wallboard\">ExtremeGreen\u2019s website</a>!</p>\n<h3><strong>Agricultural Waste Might Be the Answer</strong></h3>\n<p>One up and coming eco friendly drywall option are wallboards manufactured from agricultural waste like wheat remnants or straw. Ortech is an Australian company prominent among others manufacturing this type of product. Their <a href=\"https://www.ortech.com.au/durra-panels/\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.ortech.com.au/durra-panels/\">Durra Panels</a> not only boast a high level of recycled agricultural waste, but they also have no formaldehyde or other chemical binders to hold the particles and fibers together. The result is a green alternative to drywall, one that homeowners love because since it doesn\u2019t release chemical vapors, it doesn\u2019t create indoor air pollution.</p>\n<h3><strong>Look at Companies Like Homasote</strong></h3>\n<p>Some companies specialize in eco-friendly manufacturing processes. Homasote is one of them. This building supply manufacturer operates on a closed-loop system, which means that all waste products produced by the manufacturing process\u2014water, dust, rejected products, scrap, and more\u2014is all recycled back into product manufacture. Companies with closed loop systems produce virtually no waste material.</p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, Homasote\u2019s products are comprised largely of recycled material. For instance, their <a href=\"http://www.homasote.com/products/designwall-interior-panels\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.homasote.com/products/designwall-interior-panels\">DesignWall 440</a>, which is a pre-finished, fabric laminated wallboard, is made of 98% recycled materials. If you\u2019d like to learn about the rest of their product line, here\u2019s a <a href=\"http://www.homasote.com/assets/files/post-consumer-recycled.pdf\" data-cke-saved-href=\"http://www.homasote.com/assets/files/post-consumer-recycled.pdf\">breakdown of each product</a> and their recycled material percentages.</p>\n<p>This is just a sampling of the eco friendly drywall options available at <?php echo $row['name']; ?> . If you\u2019re looking for more options\u2014or things like eco-friendly insulation and other products\u2014feel free to take a look at all our suppliers have to offer, or contact us for more information!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[yotuwp type=&#8221;videos&#8221; id=&#8221;WC-bYJQpbDM&#8221; ]</p>\n",
