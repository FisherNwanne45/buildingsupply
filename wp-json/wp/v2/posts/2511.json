    "rendered": "<p>When homeowners think of porches, they usually think of traditional homes. But the truth is, lots of homes, even in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, have plenty of porch space to work with! This goes for both homes in more traditional styles, and modern condos, too. If you\u2019re looking for modern front porch ideas that will work complement an <a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/modernize-the-historic-urban-environment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">urban lifestyle</a> in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, here are a few contemporary porch options to consider!</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>1. Try Privacy&nbsp;<span class=\"wsc-grammar-problem\" data-grammar-phrase=\"Screens\" data-grammar-rule=\"PUNCTUATION_PARAGRAPH_END\" data-wsc-lang=\"en_US\">Screens</span></strong></h3>\n<p>In an urban setting, privacy is often a concern! You want to enjoy the comfort of your front porch, but you don\u2019t necessarily want to look at the neighbors\u2014or have them looking at you. Privacy screening is a great upgrade that serves double duty as both decoration and a way to make your porch a little more cozy. There are lots of options, including traditional screens, or for something a little fancier try a wood or <a href=\"https://www.woodwayproducts.com/products/lattice-screen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">latticework screens</a> from Woodway products still gives you a view while at the same time shielding the porch\u2019s occupants from sight.</p>\n<h3><strong>2. Consider Glass Railing for a Sleek Look</strong></h3>\n<p>For a true contemporary design, glass porch <a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/choose-the-right-railing-system-for-boston-deck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">railing</a> will give you a smooth, sleek look\u2014and it won\u2019t obstruct the view. Modern glass rails are shatter-proof, which means they serve as safety railing in addition to decoration, and they come in lots of styles. Full glass panels will give you a smooth, clean look while glass slats soften the contemporary design a little bit by adding a slightly more traditional style to the railing.</p>\n<h3><strong>3. Metal Rails are Popular, Too</strong></h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re not a fan of the glass look, then think about using metal railings instead. <a href=\"https://www.rdirail.com/homeowner/products/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RDI railing products</a> have popular modern front porch railing option that can be designed to suit a variety of home styles. Choose wrought iron or simple metal bars for more traditional homes. For more contemporary homes, cable railings are both popular and stylish.</p>\n<h3><strong>4. Upgrade Your Porch\u2019s Pillars</strong></h3>\n<p>Porch columns are often overlooked in favor of railings and d\u00e9cor, but the right columns can completely remake the look of the porch. Craftsman homes look amazing with square columns and rounded or scrolled pillars work well with homes that have more classical styling. Narrow square or round pillars can help you build on a contemporary look, too. For more ideas, check out some of the options at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hbgcolumns.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HB&amp;G Columns</a>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2509 size-large\" src=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8-Contemporary-porch-ideas-that-complement-urban-living-400x600.png\" alt=\"8 Contemporary porch ideas that complement urban living\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\"></p>\n<h3><strong>5. Don\u2019t Forget Post Caps!</strong></h3>\n<p>Not all porch columns go floor-to-ceiling. For porches with shorter posts, you\u2019ll definitely want to choose post caps that complement your overall theme. These can range from simple finials that give the post a square, finished look to elaborate caps that feature scrolling and replicate the look of fine woodwork.</p>\n<h3><strong>6. Consider Lighting Carefully</strong></h3>\n<p>Where lighting is concerned, there are lots of options to consider. Overhead lights keep the porch bright and beautiful at night, and there are lots of options to consider, including can lights, pendants and even themed chandeliers. Lights to either side of the door make a front porch feel welcoming. Contemporary homes sometimes place lighting lower\u2014on the porch rails, for instance. These days, you can even purchase post caps fitted with LED lights that provide a stylish, modern source of illumination.</p>\n<h3><strong>7. What about Flooring?</strong></h3>\n<p>Flooring is another thing you\u2019ll want to keep in mind. Depending on the look you\u2019re going for, options range between wood (or wood lookalikes) on traditional porches while contemporary porches can work well with wood, concrete or even stone and ceramic tiles.</p>\n<h3><strong>8. Don\u2019t Skimp on Furnishings!</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen railings, columns, colors and flooring, the next step is to choose furnishings that go with the theme you\u2019ve created! Porches are comfortable places, designed to while away the afternoon or evening in comfort. Definitely go with cozy armchairs, and if you have the space, maybe even a sofa. End tables selected to suit the home\u2019s style will give you a place to set drinks or the book that you\u2019re reading, and you may even add little extras like a small fire pit, candles or other bits of d\u00e9cor to amp up that restful feeling even more!</p>\n<p>Front porch design is all about creating a welcoming, comfortable place to visit with friends or enjoy a beautiful afternoon or evening. Choose some of these ideas as you upgrade your porch, and you\u2019ll be able to create a cozy space even in an urban environment!</p>\n",
