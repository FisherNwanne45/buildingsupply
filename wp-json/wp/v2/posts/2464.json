What\u2019s more, <a href=\"https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/taking-look-aluminum-clad-windows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">clad windows are durable</a>, which is a must in places like <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, where the weather isn\u2019t always kind to exterior wood. Want to learn more about clad windows? Read on, and you\u2019ll see why they make a great choice for <?php echo $row['country']; ?> homes, and you\u2019ll learn a little bit about Jeld-Wen\u2019s Siteline series of clad windows, too!</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<h3><strong>Wood-Clad Windows and Doors: What Are They?</strong></h3>\n<p>Before we get into the benefits of clad wood windows and doors, it\u2019ll help to learn a little bit about how these windows are designed. A clad wood window is one with a wooden frame, but the exterior surfaces of the window are clad with another material\u2014typically either vinyl or aluminum. This is true for clad doors, too. A door with cladding will have a wooden frame in which the wood is exposed indoors, but on the outdoor side, the wood is covered with vinyl or aluminum.</p>\n<p>And just so you know the difference, a vinyl wood-clad window differs from a vinyl window in that the wood clad version has a wooden frame, whereas a traditional vinyl window does not have a wood frame or any wooden components. The same goes for aluminum wood-clad windows versus solid aluminum windows\u2014aluminum clad will have wooden framework where regular aluminum windows will not.</p>\n<h3><strong>Why Choose Clad Wood Windows and Doors?</strong></h3>\n<p>Solid vinyl, <a href=\"https://<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/fiberglass-vs-vinyl-windows-for-your-boston-residential-home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fiberglass</a> and aluminum windows rose in popularity over wood for a long time because of their durability against the elements. These materials don\u2019t warp the way that wood can, they\u2019re much easier to maintain, and they can handle everything that <?php echo $row['country']; ?> weather has to throw at them.</p>\n<p>But, if you love the warm, rich look of wood indoors, then aluminum, fiberglass and vinyl windows are problematic. That\u2019s one of the biggest reasons why more and more people are choosing clad windows and doors\u2014because on the outside, the cladding gives these windows the durability of a vinyl or aluminum window, but inside, the homeowner still gets to enjoy the look of real wood.</p>\n<p>Additionally, clad windows offer energy savings over traditional wood windows. Wood windows can be drafty, whereas clad windows resist air infiltration, which keeps the home warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer.</p>\n<h3><strong>Using Clad Windows in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> Homes</strong></h3>\n<p>One reason why clad windows are becoming popular in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is because of their design versatility. <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, in particular, has a diverse array of homes\u2014everything from brownstones and triple deckers to newer, more modern condos. In older homes, natural woodwork inside is a great selling point, and outside, the sky is the limit as far as colors and material choices go. More modern homes may require eye-catching colors or sleek finishes, while brownstones and triple deckers will look great with windows in traditional styles with more muted colors.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jeld-wen.com/en-us/featured/siteline-wood-windows-and-patio-doors\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.jeld-wen.com/en-us/featured/siteline-wood-windows-and-patio-doors\">Jeld-Wen\u2019s Siteline</a>&nbsp;windows come in. This is a line of clad windows that offers the utmost in design versatility.
