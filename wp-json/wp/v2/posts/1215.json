    "rendered": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know that the best way to dress for cool, damp and windy days is to layer on the clothing, right? In addition to wearing a shirt and sweater, most of us add a windbreaker to help keep away drafts. Even if temperatures don\u2019t drop into the frigid zone, it\u2019s a smart way to protect against chills.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same is true for your home. If your energy bills soar when autumn gives way to the cold and wind of winter, why not consider adding some extra layers of protection? With simple, low-cost weatherizing home fixes, you\u2019ll not only boost your comfort quotient, but almost certainly save money. You\u2019ll also be doing your share for the environment by reducing your energy use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is particularly true in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>\u2019s brownstones and triple deckers. These historic buildings are beautiful, but if the weatherization hasn\u2019t been updated in a while, then you could be using a lot more energy than necessary.</span></p>\n<p><b>Air Leaks and Inadequate Insulation May Be Costing You</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In older buildings like brownstones and triple deckers, there are lots of places that air can be escaping if the weatherization hasn\u2019t been updated in a while. Be sure to check all of the following:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check the weatherstripping around windows and exterior doors. Replace it if necessary.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Caulk and seal around any plumbing pipes, water lines, ductwork or electrical conduit that penetrates, walls, ceilings or floors.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insulate heating and water lines in a basement or under sinks, especially if they\u2019re on the north or east side of the house.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel drafts near light switches or receptacles, remove the plates and install foam pads behind them.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make certain your interior wood trim has no visible gaps; repair or seal trim work as needed.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check kitchen and bath exhaust fans for proper function. You don\u2019t want to hear rattles or wind whistles.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep your dryer vent and hose clean, unblocked and working well. Replace your furnace filter for efficiency\u2019s sake.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have single-pane windows and no storm windows, even modern window film will help alleviate drafts and keep warm air in. Hang thermal drapes for an extra layer of warmth.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repair plaster cracks on interior walls and do some detective work to find other gaps and air leaks.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next up is your insulation. In older <?php echo $row['country']; ?> homes, unfortunately,&nbsp; wall insulation may not be up to modern standards. In attic spaces, loose insulation might have settled, or there may be none under the eaves. Batt insulation can be added easily, even though it might not be a DIY project. If the wall cavities of your historic home are currently filled only with insulating sheets of old newspaper, investigate modern ways to blow in fiberglass, cellulose or cotton insulation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Replacement Windows and Doors Can Save Big</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In older homes around <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, windows can be a huge source of heat and energy loss\u2014and modernized windows can remedy that. According to the EPA, American homes on average can save $126 to $456 per year replacing dated single-pane windows, and $27 to $111 replacing double paned windows. If your brownstone or triple decker has older windows, particularly single paned windows, then it\u2019s time for an upgrade!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The same is true for doors, though to a lesser extent. Older doors can let heat out in the winter if they\u2019re not well insulated whereas replacing your entry doors with modern, insulated versions can help you cut heating costs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this, also be sure to insulate properly around windows and doors. Frames are a likely spot for air leaks, so it\u2019s worth taking moldings down and filling any voids that you find with insulation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Consider a Professional Energy Audit</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A self-assessment of your home will really help in finding air leaks and inefficiencies\u2014but if you want to maximize energy efficiency, then consider a professional</span><a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/weatherize/home-energy-audits\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home energy audit</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. An auditor will be able to come in using devices like infrared cameras and blower doors to do a room-by-room assessment of your home and pinpoint inefficiencies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, our <?php echo $row['name']; ?> team can answer your questions and offer advice, and we\u2019ll be only too happy to help you find ways that go easy on your budget! The good news is that upping the R-value of your insulation adds value to your home as well. Finally, if you\u2019re building new or planning an addition or renovation project, talk with your contractor about the importance of sealing, weatherizing, R-value and energy efficiency. It\u2019s as smart a move for keeping cool in the summer as it is for staying warm in the winter.</span></p>\n",
