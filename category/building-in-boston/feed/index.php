<p><span data-contrast="auto">Not only is ACRE a sustainable, low-maintenance alternative to wood, but it’s also easy to with on the job site.

Once your project is complete, you can be confident ACRE will stand up to water, weather, fire, pests, and UV for years to come, backed by an industry-leading materials guarantee.</span></p>

<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Acoustics</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. In commercial spaces, quality acoustics are essential.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">This year, interior designers and door manufacturers are putting a fun twist on doors with various shapes and sizes, often incorporating wide and tall doors into design. These oversized doors offer increased accessibility for users, more natural light (which also increases productivity!), and even creates the illusion of a bigger space while elevating your aesthetics.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When it comes colors, door trends are all over the board: from dark and moody to light neutrals, you can’t go wrong with your color palette.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">A few of 2022’s trending interior door colors include the following:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Jewel tones</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. In sharp contrast with moody blacks and browns, there has been a surge of brightly colored accent doors like emerald green and sapphire blue that make a statement.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></li>



<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Natural neutrals</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">No matter what interior design choices you make, don’t underestimate the doors—make sure they complement your space and make a statement.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In an era of contemporary looks, traditional and elaborate doors are out, and simple modern doors are in.

<p>When trying to nail down the details for your decking project, it can often be daunting to know where to start. What decking material do you choose? Where do you get your decking from? How do you get it to the jobsite?</p>



<p>All these questions are common for contractors when finding composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>—however, the process for building or replacing a deck and finding a good company to supply the materials can be simple if you follow these steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Find a Reputable <?php echo $row['country']; ?> Decking Company</h2>



<p>The first step of this process is to do your research and know your options—whether you use the Internet or word of mouth, your first job is to find a building materials company that sells composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> and delivers to your jobsite.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Choose Colors &amp; Materials</h2>



<p>The next step of this process is the fun part: picking out the products! Once you find a good company and sales representative to work with, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/design-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit their showroom</a> to view their decking options and get help from their design team.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Wood vs. Composite Decking</h3>



<p>One of the most common questions for decking contractors and homeowners is a big one: should you invest in <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/trex-decking-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional wood decking or composite decking</a>? While wood decking might seem more appealing from a cost perspective, Trex composite decking offers the following benefits:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Weather resistant</strong>. Unlike traditional wood decking, Trex composite decking doesn’t rot or warp from intense weather exposure—a nice benefit for <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s harsh winters.</li>



<li><strong>Environmentally friendly</strong>. Trex decking is made from <a href="https://www.trex.com/why-trex/eco-friendly-decking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95% recycled materials</a> including reclaimed wood and recycled film to minimize waster and maximize sustainability.</li>



<li><strong>Low maintenance</strong>. If you’re looking for a low maintenance deck, Trex is the deck for you. With composite decking, you won’t have to worry about constant restraining, splintering, or insect damage like you do with traditional wood decking.</li>
</ol>



<p>Trex decking comes in three different lines for you to choose from: Transcend, Select, and Enhance, with different colors, sizes, pricing, and streaking available to fit your decking project needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Deck Railing</h3>



<p>Every new deck needs new railing—find a variety of styles and posts to complete your deck with Trex composite deck railing. With ADA compliance, easy configuration and maintenance, and a wide range of colors and finishes, Trex railing is the perfect choice for a stunning deck.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Outdoor Lighting</h3>



<p>When it comes to both entertainment and relaxation on a deck, ambience and lighting are everything. Trex’s outdoor lighting line is designed to be inviting, enhance curb appeal, and highlight your deck by showing it off to visitors and neighbors while serving all your outdoor lighting needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Order Product</h2>



<p>Once your sales rep and design team have helped you find the perfect composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it’s time for one of the last steps of the process: determining size and ordering the products. When determining deck size, there are two basic rules you should follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>No section of the deck should be bigger than the biggest room in the house; and</li>



<li>The deck should not be bigger than 20% of the house’s total square footage.</li>
</ol>



<p>Begin sketching your deck design ideas on graph paper using these rules and try to imagine the deck you’re creating. Do the different deck areas flow together, or do they feel choppy and separated? Is the deck too big or too small? Do you have enough space to put furniture and move around freely? Once you decide on all the details, your sales rep will help you determine how much product you need to order.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Jobsite Delivery</h2>



<p>It’s time for the final and most exciting step: delivery day! When working with a reputable company that sells composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, make sure they give you an accurate delivery timeline and include product delivery in their service offerings. Living in a big city like <?php echo $row['country']; ?> requires tall boom trucks able to reach high and navigate busy streets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">High Quality Composite Decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> from NEBS</h2>

<p>We all know how easy it is to get caught up in the “fun” things that come with designing a home—kitchen countertops, paint color, landscaping, the list goes on. But have you paused to think about your exterior siding? After all, siding is the first thing you and anyone else will see when looking at your home, so it’s best to put lots of thought into it and use it to make a statement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">How to Choose Your Siding Colors</h2>



<p><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/whats-the-best-siding-for-your-boston-home/">Choosing your siding</a> can be a stressful process when you’re not familiar with your options. Choose wisely and carefully with these siding color tips—unlike painting a house, your siding is more expensive and timely to replace.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">1. Home Style</h3>



<p>First things first: what is the style of your home and neighborhood? Often the style of your home can help determine which siding color you should use.</p>



<p>The most popular home styles in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Colonial</strong>. From bright colors to muted grays and traditional whites, anything goes with a Colonial home style.</li>



<li><strong>Greek Revival</strong>. For Greek Revival homes, it’s best to stick with classic whites, ivories, and other light palettes.</li>



<li><strong>Cape-Style</strong>. Cape-Style homes are usually more limited to the traditional Federal and Georgian Colonial period colors—ochre, reddish-brown, blues, and greens are all great choices.</li>



<li><strong>Mid-Century Modern</strong>. When it comes to Mid-Century Modern homes, dark grays and contrasting textures and colors are the name of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Contemporary</strong>. Choose from a wide range of color options for Contemporary homes including blue, deep gray, cobalt, natural wood, charcoal, and white.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, you do not have to determine your siding color based on your home style, but it is helpful to assess the neighborhood you’re in and make sure your siding complements your home instead of contrasting it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">2. Siding &amp; Trim Colors</h3>



<p>When choosing your siding color, also <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/update-your-trim-design-increases-overall-home-value/">keep trim color in mind</a>—whether you have one or two siding colors, your trim color must complement your siding choice. A common trim choice is white, but you might need more of a pop of color to contrast neutral siding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Trending Siding Colors</h2>



<p>Now that you narrowed down your <a href="https://www.jameshardie.com/color-and-design/house-color-visualizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision for your home</a>, it’s time to put it to action but choosing your siding color. James Hardie offers a variety of siding colors and palettes to choose from including classic whites, cool grays, and soft blues and greens.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">White</h3>



<p>If you’re looking for a style to withstand time, Arctic White is the perfect color for you—its elegance and purity maintain a classic look that will stay with you throughout many years to come.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Gray</h3>



<p>When it comes to grays, James Hardie has them all: soft light grays, dark statement grays, and everything in between. Here are a few of 2022’s most popular gray siding colors:</p>



<ol>
<li>Pearl Gray</li>



<li>Light Mist</li>



<li>Gray Slate</li>



<li>Night Gray</li>



<li>Aged Pewter</li>



<li>Iron Gray</li>
</ol>



<p>Lighter grays lend for a light and polished look, while the medium to dark grays accomplish the bold and modern style.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Blue</h3>



<p>If you’re going for more character and less neutrals, calming blues might be the palette for you. Boothbay Blue and Evening Blue both offer a sense of peacefulness and hominess while maintaining elegance and uniqueness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Green</h3>



<p>Much like shades of blue are Hardie’s greens: Mountain Sage and Heathered Moss. Mountain Sage is soft and understated with earthy tones, while Heathered Moss leans a little more lively, fresh. And inviting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Quality Exterior Siding &amp; Trim for NEBS</h2>



<p>There’s no stronger first impression of your character and aesthetics than the exterior siding on your home—make sure you do your research and choose your siding colors carefully.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<figure class="alignwide wp-block-post-featured-image"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2560" height="1707" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1470717023-scaled-1.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="lumber prices" style="object-fit:cover;" srcset="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1470717023-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, <?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1470717023-scaled-1-768x512.jpg 768w, <?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1470717023-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, <?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1470717023-scaled-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, <?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/shutterstock_1470717023-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>


<p>Since COVID-19 hit two years ago, lumber prices have skyrocketed to heights that America has never seen before. Besides the pandemic, wildfires, and other factors, the building materials and housing industry is now dealing with an added tariff on Canadian softwood imports.</p>



<p>After a few months of regularity, high lumber prices are now back. Americans are wondering: is there an end in sight?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Understanding the New Lumber Tariff</h2>



<p>In November, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its intent to impose a 17.9% tariff on Canadian softwood lumber—a tariff <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/canadian-lumber-tariffs-for-boston-building-industry/">twice as high as the previous tariff</a>. Recently, industry organizations like the NLMBDA (National Lumber &amp; Building Materials Dealers Association) lobbied to decrease the tariff and were successful. As of early this month, the tariff is now 11.64%.</p>



<p>Although the lower tariff is good news, American lumber companies and builders are still struggling with increased costs, impacting new home builds and developments across the nation. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, lumber and wood products have climbed <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WPS081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">30% since last September</a>.</p>



<p>The new tariff encourages American consumers to buy American lumber, but can the sawmills keep up?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Impact on <?php echo $row['country']; ?> Renters &amp; Buyers</h2>



<p>As a fast-growing city, <?php echo $row['country']; ?> relies on the local lumberyards, contractors, and builders to bring economic growth to the area. Because of its proximity, the U.S. imports roughly 70% of all its lumber for the year from Canada, causing prices to rise quickly due to any increased tariff.</p>



<p>Who suffers from high lumber prices? Builders, lumberyards, buyers, and renters.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Lumberyards and companies</strong>. American lumber companies will now pay an extra $99 in tariffs for every thousand feet of Canadian softwood lumber.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Buyers and builders</strong>. As material prices increase and supply decreases, supply and demand sets in. The average new build is now priced $18,600 compared to recent years due to lumber prices.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Renters</strong>. The housing industry impacts everyone—for renters, housing affordability is climbing and so are poverty levels.</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s a push for buying American-made, but that push has a severe impact on the American penny and the American family. As lumber companies hike up their prices, American consumers pay the price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">The Comeback of Lower Lumber Prices</h2>



<p>Lower lumber prices are in sight, but not anytime soon. Due to the rise of summer construction and building projects, lumber usually sees a sharp incline in the spring with a decline in the fall. This year, expect lumber prices to level off as winter approaches, but plan to not see savings or a decline until fall of 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Build <?php echo $row['country']; ?> with Trusted Lumber Experts from NEBS</h2>



<p>In the midst of a frenzied economy and a strained industry, demand is high and product is tight—you need a trusted local partner to ensure you get your materials at a fair price with timely delivery.</p>



<p>At <?php echo $row['name']; ?> , we pride ourselves on supplying you with quality lumber, loyal partnerships, and up-to-date industry experts to bring value to all your <?php echo $row['country']; ?> building projects. <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/contact-us/">Give us a call today</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/x8siBpFrxPWzwXjB6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stop by our downtown <?php echo $row['country']; ?> showroom</a> to speak with a team member and start your project with NEBS.</p>

<p>Every new year brings new trends and possibilities—keep reading to learn more about how to keep your outdoor living space functional and fresh in 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">1. Maximize &amp; Modernize</h2>



<p>With quarantine and COVID-19 still hanging over our heads, interest in outdoor living space is only increasing—and we don’t expect it to go away anytime soon. Homeowners are loving bringing their home outside and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/8-contemporary-porch-ideas-that-complement-urban-living-2/">maximizing their outdoor space</a> for both personal and party time.</p>



<p>If you have the room, why not expand? As backyards and patios become an extension of the home to relax in and entertain, homebuilders are building out with <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/summer-deck-design-trends/">modern designs</a>. Hop on the modern design trend with composite decking, neutral colors, and functional luxury.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">2. Multi-Functional</h2>



<p>Along with maximizing space, homeowners are also looking to maximize their outdoor living space’s potential by making it multi-functional for any season of the year. To use your deck year-round, try adding some of the following aspects to your outdoor living space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Firepit or fireplace for cozy winter nights;</li>



<li>Covered TV for fall football;</li>



<li><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/weatherproof-outdoor-cabinets-2/">Outdoor kitchens</a> for summer barbeques; and</li>

</ul>



<p>You’re investing so much into your outdoor living space—why not make it functional?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">3. Fireplaces &amp; Firepits</h2>



<p>Firepits aren’t just for cold weather—they’re perfect for summer marshmallow roasts and late-night fall reads. Or, for the men in the house, add a firepit for an outdoor man cave to keep you warm and relaxed as you watch a Patriots game.</p>



<p>Although all types of fireplaces and fireplaces have shown extreme popularity, homeowners are quicky turning to gas-powered fire features for easy use, cleaning, and maintenance. They also compliment the modern living trend, adding to the sleek and smooth aesthetic that everyone loves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">4. Monochromatic Colors</h2>



<p>Each new year brings different color trends to the mix—in 2022, homeowners are all about monochromatic colors. This trend is accompanied by pops of color in plant pots, outdoor furniture, and other accessories, or dark accent colors like charcoal for walkways, stairs, and retaining walls.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">5. Composite Decking</h2>



<p>One outdoor living trend that will never get old is composite decking. Trex decking offers the best of both worlds: modern and sleek, easy to clean, durable, and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/sustainable-building-trex/">environmentally friendly</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re involved in the modern construction and building materials world, you’ve heard the term “green building”. Our society is focused on preserving the earth, using sustainable materials, and mental health and wellbeing—that&#8217;s where green building comes into play.</p>



<p>There are countless benefits to going green from environmental to social that will allow you to increase customer satisfaction, builder interest, and even your company&#8217;s success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">What is Green Building?</h2>



<p>Green building is a staple in the booming <?php echo $row['country']; ?> market to:</p>



<ol>
<li>Reduce use of resources and materials;</li>



<li>Reduce waste and carbon footprint;</li>



<li>Increase building occupant productivity; and</li>



<li>Reduce life cycle cost.</li>
</ol>



<p>To accomplish these goals, green buildings use natural materials, land, energy, and even water to help improve wellbeing for both occupants and the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Benefits of Green Building</h2>



<p>When it comes to green building, there are countless benefits—not only does green building create sustainable communities, but it also brings tremendous economic growth as well. The benefits of green building cover three important categories: social, economic, and of course, environmental.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">1. Environmental</h3>



<p>The most important benefit that green building offers is positive environmental impact. Green buildings do so by using less water, energy, and natural resources by creating their own energy and increasing biodiversity.</p>



<p>Compared to other industries, the building industry has the <a href="https://www.uncclearn.org/sites/default/files/inventory/unep207.pdf">biggest potential for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions</a>. In fact, studies show that LEED certified buildings in the United States use 25% less energy and 11% less water than traditional buildings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">2. Social</h3>



<p>Aside from the obvious environmental benefits that green building brings, they also have positive impacts on physical and mental health and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Here are a few ways building green can benefit our personal health and wellbeing:</p>



<ul>
<li>People who work in green buildings that are well-ventilated increase their brain function by 101%.</li>



<li>Employees with windows in their office <a href="https://aasm.org/study-links-workplace-daylight-exposure-to-sleep-activity-and-quality-of-life/">sleep 46 minutes more each night</a> than those without windows.</li>



<li>High ventilation, low CO2 concentration, and better indoor air quality can improve employee performance by up to 8%.</li>
</ul>



<p>In recent years, there has been enormous focus on mental health and wellbeing in both work environments and day to day life—green building is a great start to tackling this issue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">3. Economic</h3>



<p>We know green building comes with environmental and social benefits, but let’s be realistic—what financial benefits come with green buildings, if any?</p>



<p>As lumber prices prepare to surge again, we can use green buildings to save money in other areas for builders, developers, buyers, and even tenants. Economic benefits of green buildings include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced utility bills;</li>



<li>Reduced construction and building costs;</li>



<li>Increased occupancy; and</li>



<li>Increased job creation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Did you know that green building currently <a href="https://www.bls.gov/green/construction/">provides 3.3 million jobs</a>? And did you know that green buildings automatically have a 7% asset increase compared to traditional buildings? We have a lot to learn about green buildings and the benefits that it can bring to all involved parties—why wait?</p>

<p>
In an already busy city that continues to grow, developers and builders are building up instead of out, limiting space for consumers. So, what does this mean for your kitchen remodel? How do you maximize the small space you have to make it feel and look bigger?</p>
<h2>Keep It Compact</h2>
<p>Many manufacturers offer small appliances for areas with limited space, like 24-inch-deep refrigerators. Another pro tip to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/kitchen-layout-ideas-for-every-home/">maximize your kitchen space</a> is to hang small appliances such as microwaves to save counter space. </p>
<h2>A Successful Center</h2>
<p>A common misconception of small kitchen design is that you should leave the middle of your space open to make it feel more spacious. However, this is not the case—maximize the space you have by putting in a <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/the-pros-and-cons-of-a-kitchen-island-for-your-boston-home/">permanent or roll-away island</a> for storage and prep space.</p>
<h2>The Glass Illusion</h2>
<p>Fun fact: glass cabinet fronts lighten the look of cabinets because of their transparency, making the kitchen seem more expansive. This can also act as an opportunity to display your pretty statement pieces such as wine glasses, bowls, or china. </p>
<h2>Expand Your Storage</h2>
<p>There are often storage issues for small kitchen appliances, utensils, and decorations in small kitchens. Minimize clutter and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/6-must-have-kitchen-cabinet-organizers-and-accessories-2/">expand storage space</a> by installing deep cabinets, drawers, and countertops. You can also get cabinet and drawer inserts to help with organization.</p>
<h2>Merge &#038; Maximize</h2>
<p>If you have an open floorplan, an easy way to maximize your kitchen space is by overflowing your kitchen into a bigger space like your living room or combining the two. A great way to do this is to put a small table and chairs in your kitchen to combine the kitchen and “dining room” or use your counter or island as a bar area. </p>
<h2>Get Rid of Clutter</h2>
<p>Messy and cluttered rooms often make a space look smaller—minimize overcrowded shelves and countertops to make the space look bigger. Choose which items you want to display in the open and hide the rest in the pantry, drawers, and cabinets.</p>
<h2>Open It Up</h2>
<p>Open shelving such as glass cabinets or floating shelves not only improve visuals and aesthetics, but they also reduce visual weight with a sleek look while acting as storage for kitchen accessories. You can also decorate your shelving with plants, photos, or other décor.</p>
<h2>Consistent Colors</h2>
<p>Matching the paint color of your cabinets and wall color will erase the visual boundary created by two different colors in a small space. If you’ve hopped on the <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/9-tips-for-two-tone-kitchen-cabinets-in-a-small-kitchen/">two-tone cabinet</a> bandwagon, it’s a good idea to choose two colors that are close in shade with only a subtle difference.</p>
<h2>Bigger Isn&#8217;t Always Better</h2>
<p>Usually, you’ll choose furnishings that will fill your space, but in the case of a small kitchen, don’t. The floorspace of small room is valuable, so don’t waste it with a big table or island. Instead, opt for sleek and thin pieces to limit physical and visual bulk. </p>
<h2>Clean Is Key</h2>
<p>If you’re a <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/minimalist-kitchen-design-tips-for-boston-homeowners/">minimalist</a>, designing a small kitchen is right in your wheelhouse. For those who prefer more decorations and details, try to keep these aspects limited and only show them off in a select few places—clean lines will create a roomier feel. </p>
<h2>Design to Expand &#038; Impress with <?php echo $row['name']; ?> </h2>
<p>In the wake of COVID-19, home renovations have never been more popular. When leaving in a high-rise apartment or condo in the heart of downtown <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it might seem like your options are limited—however, there are many ways to expand the feel of your space if you work with the right products.</p>

As stay-at-home orders and closures increased, homeowners turned their attention to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/5-top-fall-projects-for-your-boston-condo-renovation/">home improvement projects</a> and outdoor living spaces.</p>
<p>
When building an <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/summer-deck-design-trends/">outdoor living space</a>, don’t forget the kitchen—an outdoor kitchen adds functionality, beauty, and value to your home. Weatherproof kitchen cabinets are the name of the game for an outdoor kitchen build with many different materials, colors, and designs to choose from to complete your outdoor oasis. </p>
<h2>Wood vs. PVC</h2>
<p>Just like any other kitchen, cabinets can add style and personality to your outdoor kitchen. Whether you add a pop of color to make a statement or simply want more storage, selecting the right material for your outdoor cabinets is crucial to the design and layout. </p>
<h3>Traditional Wood Cabinets</h3>
<p>Wood cabinets are not quite as durable as other materials, but there are specific types of wood that are better to use for outdoor living. A few of the woods you might want to consider are bamboo, teak, or cypress. </p>
<p>
Here are a few perks to using wood cabinets in your outdoor kitchen:</p>
<ul>
•	They have environmentally friendly options; and<br />
•	They are easy to stain and finish to match any color or design scheme.
</ul>
<p>The following are the less enjoyable aspects of using wooden cabinetry outside:</p>
<ul>
•	They require regular upkeep;<br />
•	They fade overtime from sun and other natural exposure;<br />
•	They are prone to cracking, warping, or swelling; and<br />
•	They are a more expensive material.
</ul>
<p>Wooden cabinets are prone to the same difficulties as any other wood product—however, you can lessen these potential problems with proper maintenance and quality wood materials. </p>
<h3>PVC NatureKast Cabinets</h3>
<p>We all know that living in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> comes with harsh weather—having outdoor kitchen cabinets that can endure the elements is still important. NatureKast cabinets are made from a man-made polymer plastic material built to <a href="https://naturekast.com/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tolerate any weather</a> with low maintenance. </p>
<p>
The benefits of using PVC cabinets for outdoor living include the following:</p>
<ul>
•	They are easy to clean and maintain;<br />
•	They are resistant to sun, rain, saltwater and snow;<br />
•	They do not fade or stain; and<br />
•	They are 100% weatherproof and waterproof, meaning NatureKast cabinets will not rust or rot.
</ul>
<p>When it comes to NatureKast, you really do have unlimited options with endless benefits—NatureKast offers a <a href="https://www.naturekast.com/stylesandfinishes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide variety styles, finishes, and colors</a> for weatherproof outdoor kitchen cabinets that will resist the elements. </p>
