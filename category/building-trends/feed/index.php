<p>We all know how easy it is to get caught up in the “fun” things that come with designing a home—kitchen countertops, paint color, landscaping, the list goes on. But have you paused to think about your exterior siding? After all, siding is the first thing you and anyone else will see when looking at your home, so it’s best to put lots of thought into it and use it to make a statement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">How to Choose Your Siding Colors</h2>



<p><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/whats-the-best-siding-for-your-boston-home/">Choosing your siding</a> can be a stressful process when you’re not familiar with your options. Choose wisely and carefully with these siding color tips—unlike painting a house, your siding is more expensive and timely to replace.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">1. Home Style</h3>



<p>First things first: what is the style of your home and neighborhood? Often the style of your home can help determine which siding color you should use.</p>



<p>The most popular home styles in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Colonial</strong>. From bright colors to muted grays and traditional whites, anything goes with a Colonial home style.</li>



<li><strong>Greek Revival</strong>. For Greek Revival homes, it’s best to stick with classic whites, ivories, and other light palettes.</li>



<li><strong>Cape-Style</strong>. Cape-Style homes are usually more limited to the traditional Federal and Georgian Colonial period colors—ochre, reddish-brown, blues, and greens are all great choices.</li>



<li><strong>Mid-Century Modern</strong>. When it comes to Mid-Century Modern homes, dark grays and contrasting textures and colors are the name of the game.</li>



<li><strong>Contemporary</strong>. Choose from a wide range of color options for Contemporary homes including blue, deep gray, cobalt, natural wood, charcoal, and white.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, you do not have to determine your siding color based on your home style, but it is helpful to assess the neighborhood you’re in and make sure your siding complements your home instead of contrasting it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">2. Siding &amp; Trim Colors</h3>



<p>When choosing your siding color, also <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/update-your-trim-design-increases-overall-home-value/">keep trim color in mind</a>—whether you have one or two siding colors, your trim color must complement your siding choice. A common trim choice is white, but you might need more of a pop of color to contrast neutral siding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Trending Siding Colors</h2>



<p>Now that you narrowed down your <a href="https://www.jameshardie.com/color-and-design/house-color-visualizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vision for your home</a>, it’s time to put it to action but choosing your siding color. James Hardie offers a variety of siding colors and palettes to choose from including classic whites, cool grays, and soft blues and greens.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">White</h3>



<p>If you’re looking for a style to withstand time, Arctic White is the perfect color for you—its elegance and purity maintain a classic look that will stay with you throughout many years to come.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Gray</h3>



<p>When it comes to grays, James Hardie has them all: soft light grays, dark statement grays, and everything in between. Here are a few of 2022’s most popular gray siding colors:</p>



<ol>
<li>Pearl Gray</li>



<li>Light Mist</li>



<li>Gray Slate</li>



<li>Night Gray</li>



<li>Aged Pewter</li>



<li>Iron Gray</li>
</ol>



<p>Lighter grays lend for a light and polished look, while the medium to dark grays accomplish the bold and modern style.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Blue</h3>



<p>If you’re going for more character and less neutrals, calming blues might be the palette for you. Boothbay Blue and Evening Blue both offer a sense of peacefulness and hominess while maintaining elegance and uniqueness.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Green</h3>



<p>Much like shades of blue are Hardie’s greens: Mountain Sage and Heathered Moss. Mountain Sage is soft and understated with earthy tones, while Heathered Moss leans a little more lively, fresh. And inviting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Quality Exterior Siding &amp; Trim for NEBS</h2>



<p>There’s no stronger first impression of your character and aesthetics than the exterior siding on your home—make sure you do your research and choose your siding colors carefully.</p>



<p>At <?php echo $row['name']; ?> , we offer a wide range of James Hardie siding and trim in all the latest trending colors.

<p>As winter weather and 2022 roll in, it’s time to start thinking about deck upgrades and builds in the coming months. Whether you’re researching ideas or looking for a decking contractor, now is the perfect time to start planning ahead and staying up to date on outdoor living trends.</p>



<p>Every new year brings new trends and possibilities—keep reading to learn more about how to keep your outdoor living space functional and fresh in 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">1. Maximize &amp; Modernize</h2>



<p>With quarantine and COVID-19 still hanging over our heads, interest in outdoor living space is only increasing—and we don’t expect it to go away anytime soon. Homeowners are loving bringing their home outside and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/8-contemporary-porch-ideas-that-complement-urban-living-2/">maximizing their outdoor space</a> for both personal and party time.</p>



<p>If you have the room, why not expand? As backyards and patios become an extension of the home to relax in and entertain, homebuilders are building out with <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/summer-deck-design-trends/">modern designs</a>. Hop on the modern design trend with composite decking, neutral colors, and functional luxury.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">2. Multi-Functional</h2>



<p>Along with maximizing space, homeowners are also looking to maximize their outdoor living space’s potential by making it multi-functional for any season of the year. To use your deck year-round, try adding some of the following aspects to your outdoor living space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Firepit or fireplace for cozy winter nights;</li>



<li>Covered TV for fall football;</li>



<li><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/weatherproof-outdoor-cabinets-2/">Outdoor kitchens</a> for summer barbeques; and</li>



<li>Waterproof furniture for spring rain.</li>
</ul>



<p>You’re investing so much into your outdoor living space—why not make it functional?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">3. Fireplaces &amp; Firepits</h2>



<p>Firepits aren’t just for cold weather—they’re perfect for summer marshmallow roasts and late-night fall reads. Or, for the men in the house, add a firepit for an outdoor man cave to keep you warm and relaxed as you watch a Patriots game.</p>



<p>Although all types of fireplaces and fireplaces have shown extreme popularity, homeowners are quicky turning to gas-powered fire features for easy use, cleaning, and maintenance. They also compliment the modern living trend, adding to the sleek and smooth aesthetic that everyone loves.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">4. Monochromatic Colors</h2>



<p>Each new year brings different color trends to the mix—in 2022, homeowners are all about monochromatic colors. This trend is accompanied by pops of color in plant pots, outdoor furniture, and other accessories, or dark accent colors like charcoal for walkways, stairs, and retaining walls.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">5. Composite Decking</h2>



<p>One outdoor living trend that will never get old is composite decking. Trex decking offers the best of both worlds: modern and sleek, easy to clean, durable, and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/sustainable-building-trex/">environmentally friendly</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re involved in the modern construction and building materials world, you’ve heard the term “green building”. Our society is focused on preserving the earth, using sustainable materials, and mental health and wellbeing—that&#8217;s where green building comes into play.</p>



<p>There are countless benefits to going green from environmental to social that will allow you to increase customer satisfaction, builder interest, and even your company&#8217;s success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">What is Green Building?</h2>



<p>Green building is a staple in the booming <?php echo $row['country']; ?> market to:</p>



<ol>
<li>Reduce use of resources and materials;</li>



<li>Reduce waste and carbon footprint;</li>



<li>Increase building occupant productivity; and</li>



<li>Reduce life cycle cost.</li>
</ol>



<p>To accomplish these goals, green buildings use natural materials, land, energy, and even water to help improve wellbeing for both occupants and the environment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Benefits of Green Building</h2>



<p>When it comes to green building, there are countless benefits—not only does green building create sustainable communities, but it also brings tremendous economic growth as well. The benefits of green building cover three important categories: social, economic, and of course, environmental.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">1. Environmental</h3>



<p>The most important benefit that green building offers is positive environmental impact. Green buildings do so by using less water, energy, and natural resources by creating their own energy and increasing biodiversity.</p>



<p>Compared to other industries, the building industry has the <a href="https://www.uncclearn.org/sites/default/files/inventory/unep207.pdf">biggest potential for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions</a>. In fact, studies show that LEED certified buildings in the United States use 25% less energy and 11% less water than traditional buildings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">2. Social</h3>



<p>Aside from the obvious environmental benefits that green building brings, they also have positive impacts on physical and mental health and wellbeing.</p>



<p>Here are a few ways building green can benefit our personal health and wellbeing:</p>



<ul>
<li>People who work in green buildings that are well-ventilated increase their brain function by 101%.</li>



<li>Employees with windows in their office <a href="https://aasm.org/study-links-workplace-daylight-exposure-to-sleep-activity-and-quality-of-life/">sleep 46 minutes more each night</a> than those without windows.</li>



<li>High ventilation, low CO2 concentration, and better indoor air quality can improve employee performance by up to 8%.</li>
</ul>



<p>In recent years, there has been enormous focus on mental health and wellbeing in both work environments and day to day life—green building is a great start to tackling this issue.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">3. Economic</h3>



<p>We know green building comes with environmental and social benefits, but let’s be realistic—what financial benefits come with green buildings, if any?</p>



<p>As lumber prices prepare to surge again, we can use green buildings to save money in other areas for builders, developers, buyers, and even tenants. Economic benefits of green buildings include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced utility bills;</li>



<li>Reduced construction and building costs;</li>



<li>Increased occupancy; and</li>



<li>Increased job creation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Did you know that green building currently <a href="https://www.bls.gov/green/construction/">provides 3.3 million jobs</a>? And did you know that green buildings automatically have a 7% asset increase compared to traditional buildings? We have a lot to learn about green buildings and the benefits that it can bring to all involved parties—why wait?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Go Green with <?php echo $row['name']; ?> </h2>



<p>At <?php echo $row['name']; ?> , we value our customers and our customers’ customers—anyone who steps foot in a project we take part in should feel satisfied and valued.</p>

As stay-at-home orders and closures increased, homeowners turned their attention to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/5-top-fall-projects-for-your-boston-condo-renovation/">home improvement projects</a> and outdoor living spaces.</p>
<p>
When building an <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/summer-deck-design-trends/">outdoor living space</a>, don’t forget the kitchen—an outdoor kitchen adds functionality, beauty, and value to your home. Weatherproof kitchen cabinets are the name of the game for an outdoor kitchen build with many different materials, colors, and designs to choose from to complete your outdoor oasis. </p>
<h2>Wood vs. PVC</h2>
<p>Just like any other kitchen, cabinets can add style and personality to your outdoor kitchen. Whether you add a pop of color to make a statement or simply want more storage, selecting the right material for your outdoor cabinets is crucial to the design and layout. </p>
<h3>Traditional Wood Cabinets</h3>
<p>Wood cabinets are not quite as durable as other materials, but there are specific types of wood that are better to use for outdoor living. A few of the woods you might want to consider are bamboo, teak, or cypress. </p>
<p>
Here are a few perks to using wood cabinets in your outdoor kitchen:</p>
<ul>
•	They have environmentally friendly options; and<br />
•	They are easy to stain and finish to match any color or design scheme.
</ul>
<p>The following are the less enjoyable aspects of using wooden cabinetry outside:</p>
<ul>
•	They require regular upkeep;<br />
•	They fade overtime from sun and other natural exposure;<br />
•	They are prone to cracking, warping, or swelling; and<br />
•	They are a more expensive material.
</ul>
<p>Wooden cabinets are prone to the same difficulties as any other wood product—however, you can lessen these potential problems with proper maintenance and quality wood materials. </p>
<h3>PVC NatureKast Cabinets</h3>
<p>We all know that living in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> comes with harsh weather—having outdoor kitchen cabinets that can endure the elements is still important. NatureKast cabinets are made from a man-made polymer plastic material built to <a href="https://naturekast.com/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tolerate any weather</a> with low maintenance. </p>
<p>
The benefits of using PVC cabinets for outdoor living include the following:</p>
<ul>
•	They are easy to clean and maintain;<br />
•	They are resistant to sun, rain, saltwater and snow;<br />
•	They do not fade or stain; and<br />

Between working from home and stay-at-home orders, homeowners have been spending more time at home and rethinking their home’s design features.</p>
<p>
One trend that is popular for 2021 is kitchen remodels—while vacations get postponed due to travel restrictions and events cancelled for health concerns, many are putting their money into new kitchen countertops.</p>
<h2>Accent Countertop Trends </h2>
<p>Accent countertops are all the rage in 2021—whether it’s a traditional veined quartz, a modern orange, or a sleek black slab, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/kitchen-islands-add-pop-of-color-to-design-scheme/">countertops and islands</a> have become the focal point in the kitchen. Here are a few accent countertop trends that you won’t want to miss in this year’s remodel.</p>
<h3>1. Veined Quartz </h3>
<p>Quartz and other stone materials have always been a popular and constant countertop trend for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
•	Quartz is stain-resistant;<br />
•	Quartz is hygienic;<br />
•	Quartz is durable; and<br />
•	Quartz is low maintenance.
</ul>
<p>Because of its consistent popularity, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/quartz-continues-to-latest-kitchen-countertop-trend/">quartz accent countertops</a> are now offered in a wide range of colors, patterns, and finishing techniques to meet any aesthetic. Veined quartz in particular is a great way to give your kitchen the wow factor without straying too far from a natural and traditional look.</p>
<h3>2. Color Pops </h3>
<p>If you’re more into the modern look and want to make a statement, a pop of color in your kitchen is the way to go. </p>
<h4>Black is Back </h4>
<p>One of the most sought-after looks is a sleek black stone countertop in contrast with striking white cabinets and brass fixtures. Another great use of <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/want-in-on-the-matte-black-kitchen-trend-6-ideas-to-help-you-pull-it-off/">black in the kitchen</a> achieves the rustic look: black accent countertops paired with rustic wood features. Either way you to choose to use it, black is certainly back.</p>
<h4>Go Bold &#038; Bright </h4>
<p>Others may be looking to make more of a splash with their interior design choices, choosing brightly colored countertops. After almost 50 years, orange and green have circled back into the kitchen remodel world and we’re here for it. If you want to liven up a monochromatic kitchen, make a statement with bold and bright accent countertops.</p>
<h3>3. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle </h3>
<p>Recycled glass countertops are quickly climbing their way to the top of homeowners’ kitchen visions, offering a way to reduce your carbon footprint while wining and dining in style. Choose from eco-friendly countertops made of recycled glass and white cement in a variety of colors to add sustainable elegance to your home. </p>
<h3>4. Industrial Interiors </h3>
<p>Concrete accent countertops are a new trend in the kitchen world—yes, we did say concrete—that are also gaining momentum. Many homeowners love the industrial look that concrete countertops bring to their kitchen, meeting the ongoing demand for an Urban aesthetic. What was once drab concrete is now a slab of art full of flecks of color ready to capture your attention!</p>
<h2>Kitchen Trends</h2>
<p>Now that you know which accent countertops are trending, it’s time to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/design-center/">design your kitchen</a>. Here are a few popular kitchen trends for 2021 that you won’t want to miss:</p>
<ul>
•	<strong>L-shaped layout</strong>. L-shaped kitchens are especially good for smaller homes or downtown <?php echo $row['country']; ?> apartments.<br />
•	<strong>Open floorplan</strong>. Supervise your kids and entertain guests while cooking with an open kitchen floorplan.<br />
•	<strong>Glass doors</strong>. Homeowners love an opportunity to showcase wine glasses and other accent pieces while protecting them from dust.<br />
•	<strong>Brushed and matte finishes</strong>. Not only are brushed finishes easier to clean, but they also serve as a great compliment to accent countertops.<br />
•	<strong>Statement backsplashes and ventilation hoods</strong>. Squares, hexagons, diamond, and other fun shapes can turn your kitchen into a statement.
</ul>
<p>Designing and completing your dream kitchen is a fun and rewarding process with lots of decisions—stay up to date on current kitchen trends to wow friends and family.</p>

For the building and construction industry, it could be interior design, architecture trends, or which city is the new hot spot for building—regardless of the trend’s current popularity, we know that will likely change in the coming years. </p>
<p>
However, there is one trend that will always be in style no matter what the day is: sustainable building. Lucky for you, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/trex-decking-benefits/">Trex decking</a> is the perfect solution for building green when it comes to your outdoor living project.</p>
<h3>What Makes Trex Decking Sustainable? </h3>
<p>Trex composite decking is made from <a href="https://www.trex.com/why-trex/eco-friendly-decking/" traget="_blank" rel="noopener">95% reclaimed wood and plastic film</a>—recycling at its finest. The following reasons are why Trex decking is the perfect choice for your sustainable building project:</p>
<ul>
•	<strong>Reclaimed wood</strong>. Trex sources local reclaimed wood for composite decking, minimizing landfill waste and tree use.<br />
•	<strong>Recycled plastic film</strong>. Trex combines reclaimed wood with recycled plastic film from paper towel overwrap, sandwich bags, newspaper sleeves, and grocery bags.</ul>
</ul>
<p>Composite decking the best choice when it comes to sustainable building. The average 500-square foot composite deck contains 140,000 recycled plastic bags, making Trex one of the largest plastic bag recyclers in the country. If you’re looking to minimize your carbon footprint and build green, using Trex decking for your outdoor living project is a no-brainer. </p>
<h3>How is Trex Decking Made? </h3>
<p>If you’re not already convinced that it’s important to find sustainable building products, let’s take a look at the production process of Trex decking:</p>
<ul>
<p>1.	Buy reclaimed wood/sawdust and recycled plastic film;<br />
2.	Clean and ground film into granules;<br />
3.	Combine and heat sawdust and film;<br />
4.	Mix mixture and form into boards;<br />
5.	Cool and cut boards;<br />
6.	Inspect boards for color accuracy, strength, and defects; and<br />
7.	Wrap and ship boards.</ul>
</ul>
<p>Not only is Trex decking an eco-friendly product, but the manufacturing process is just as green when it comes to eliminating environmental waste. Almost 100% of Trex’s factory runoff from production is recycled and reused for the next project!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s almost that time of year—home improvement time! Whether you are building a kitchen from scratch or renovating a fix and flip, it’s important to make sure the kitchen you build is timeless.</p>
<p>Many popular home improvement shows love to display beautiful renovated kitchens with sleek appliances, modern flares, and bright accents. Although these trendy kitchens get us excited about our own kitchen renovation possibilities, it’s important to think about what will always be “in”. Designing a timeless kitchen will not only bring lasting beauty to your space, but it will also save you from constant renovation projects.</p>
<p>Creating a timeless kitchen is actually quite easy—here are a few tips to help you get started.</p>
<h2>1. Neutral Colors</h2>
<p>Even though orange accents are popular right now, will they still be popular in 10 or 20 years? You might love a certain color or style right now, but just like everything else, kitchen design trends are constantly changing.</p>
<p>Using <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/5-tried-and-true-kitchen-color-schemes/">neutral colors</a> will ensure a classic and finished look—grays, whites, browns, and blacks are all colors that will always stay in style. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t put a personal touch in your new kitchen with your favorite color trends. Accent the space with fun area rugs, backsplash, tablecloths/table runners, curtains, flower arrangements, and other decor.</p>
<h2>2. Stone Countertops</h2>
<p>Stone countertops are one kitchen trend that you can always expect to be in style. Quartz and granite countertops are durable and easy to clean while giving a constant sparkle to your kitchen. No matter what colors you like, a neutral stone countertop will match your kitchen design and style as an attractive center of attention for years to come.</p>
<h2>3. Subway Tile</h2>
<p>Another timeless kitchen tradition is subway tile—it’s affordable, beautiful, and classic. Subway tile can add some personality to your kitchen while giving it a clean and finished look. Whether you use it as an accent wall or backsplash, subway tile is a great decorative addition to any kitchen.</p>
<h2>4. Shaker Style Cabinets</h2>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of using shaker style cabinets in your kitchen is that they are affordable and versatile. Shaker style cabinets are easy to construct and repair, which means that you won’t break the bank if a cabinet breaks. Plus, their sleek and decorative look will match any type of kitchen from modern to traditional!</p>
<h2>5. Glass Cabinet Doors</h2>
<p>Although we love shaker style cabinets, let’s not forget about our other favorite—glass cabinet doors. Glass cabinet doors are an easy way to store glassware and brighten up your kitchen by showing off those beautiful serving platters and wedding china. Combined with the right lighting, glass cabinet doors create the illusion of a bigger space and openness, which is great for small condo or apartment kitchens in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>.</p>
<h2>Don’t Forget the Details</h2>
<p>Choosing the right <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/resources/">cabinets and countertops</a> for a timeless kitchen are important, but don’t forget other important details when designing your kitchen. Remember to install high-quality appliances that with beauty and durability, as well as adequate overhead lighting that will provide visibility while cooking and compliment the space.</p>
<p>Another mark of a great kitchen is openness and organization—these two aspects never go out of style and are often a priority to home buyers when looking for the perfect kitchen. A great way to add value to your kitchen is by adding an island for extra workspace and installing wall shelves and drawer organizers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you thinking about building a deck? Adding or renovating your property’s deck is a great way to add value and beauty to your property— but like every building project, there are some things you need to know before you start. Depending on where you live, your budget, and your personal tastes, your decking material options might differ from others&#8217;. Each decking material comes with its own maintenance requirements, aesthetic appeal, cost, and other important factors to keep in mind when choosing what&#8217;s right for you and your home.</p>
<h2>Introducing Trex Composite Decking</h2>
<p>One of the most popular types of decking in 2021 is Trex. If you’re in the building materials industry world, you’ve probably heard the debate between Trex and wood. Trex decking is a great alternative to wood decking, especially since it looks exactly like wood.</p>
<p>Although it looks like wood, composite decking is a durable composite material that is made from plastic, wood fibers, and a bonding agent— all recycled materials, which is a popular trend in today’s environmentally conscious society. Trex is greener and more durable—what more could you want for your deck?</p>
<h2>Why Trex?</h2>
<p>When picking out any building material, there’s always four factors to consider: cost, maintenance, eco-friendliness, and of course, look and aesthetics. There are many advantages to using composite decking over wood decking.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>In general, Trex decking is typically a bigger investment than wood decking. As we mentioned earlier, Trex is a more durable material, which means it lasts longer than wood. With wood decking, you’ll be replacing warped and damaged woods—we know how the weather gets in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Although composite decking is a bigger investment, you’ll be saving money in the long run.</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>Not all decking materials are made the same, and not all of them have the same durability. The goal is to get a finished product that will last for years, but that’s not the reality for most decks. Wood decking requires more maintenance than Trex for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weather</strong>. As we mentioned above, living in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> comes with a lot of weather and harsh elements—you’ll have to replace warped or damaged boards and frequently paint and reseal wood.</li>
<li><strong>Critters</strong>. Unwanted critters, especially termites, are a common problem with wood decking. There’s no proven way to stop them from feasting on your deck, which will add up to constant repairs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Eco-Conscious</h3>
<p>Trex decking is made from 95% recycled materials, making it the ultimate choice for an environmentally-sound conscious. These materials include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grocery and bakery bags,</li>
<li>Newspaper and produce bags,</li>
<li>Toilet paper packaging and paper towel packaging,</li>
<li>Water bottle packaging,</li>
<li>Dry cleaning plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>You name it, Trex recycles it into decking! It is possible to find reclaimed wood for your decking project, but most wood decking is made from timber harvested from forests. If you’re looking to lessen your carbon footprint, Trex is definitely the greener choice.</p>
<h3>Look &amp; Aesthetics</h3>
<p>Last but certainly not least, always consider the overall look and aesthetics of your deck—not only should your deck look nice, but it also should match the home it’s attached to. When using wood decking, you must look at color and grain, which are more limited in options than that of Trex decking.</p>
<p>When you choose Trex decking you, you immediately have a bigger variety of colors to choose from, making it much easier to match your vision for your newly renovated home. You also will avoid stains and fading, which a common problem with wood decking.</p>
<h2>Interested in Using Trex Decking? Contact a Decking Expert at <?php echo $row['name']; ?> Today</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve gone over the benefits of Trex decking, it’s time for you to choose what will work best for your project. Although composite decking is a bigger investment, it’s just that—an investment. Trex is an investment for a more durable, greener, better-looking decking option which will ultimately be more cost-effective.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Options for kitchen countertops have never been more plentiful. But while having many options to choose from can be exciting, it can also make the decision more difficult. You could choose from </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">atural stone, poured concrete, recycled glass or cardboard, tile, manufactured materials or sustainable alternatives, but two of the most popular </span><a href="http://homerenovations.about.com/od/LaminateCounters/fl/Quartz-vs-Laminate-Countertops-Which-Is-Best-For-You.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">countertop options</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are laminate and quartz. To choose between them, it is important to understand the pros and cons of laminate versus quartz.</span></p>
<p><b>All About Laminate Countertops</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laminate is looking better than ever before, considering that the material so popular for kitchen countertops has been around for more than 100 years! Formica laminate was </span><a href="http://amhistory.si.edu/archives/AC0565.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">invented</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 1912 by two Westinghouse employees who were looking for a manufactured product to replace mica as electrical insulation. Today, it is commonly considered a budget-friendly, stylish and functional countertop. Residential and commercial applications for laminate have spawned numerous other brands of laminate, but all feature a base of “sandwiched” material covered by a thin topping of colored or patterned synthetic sheeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technological advances in the manufacture of laminate countertops have enhanced not only its performance, but also its appearance. Seamless and rolled-edge laminates simulate natural stone, while trendy looks are achieved with vibrant colors, inlays, and “color-through” options. New edge treatments allow great versatility and eliminate unsightly seams of early counters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laminate is heat resistant and non-porous, but it can be damaged by sharp knives and the surface is subject to tears and delaminating in some cases. However, with reasonable care, modern laminate is a long-lasting, cost-effective option—and the design choices are virtually limitless. While it is possible to purchase pre-formed laminate countertops for DIY installation, high-quality laminate countertops and unique counter treatments should be installed by a professional.</span></p>
<p><b>All About Quartz Countertops</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A viable option for granite today is an engineered product often known as quartz. Quartz countertops are commonly manufactured with bits of quartz and cast-off bits of stone, ceramic, glass and other materials, bound together with a glue-like resin. The process was developed and patented in the mid-1960s and, like laminate, the intervening years have seen the birth of a variety of “manufactured stone” companies, each offering a slightly different take on the product.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Early quartz countertops were durable, but not terribly attractive. Not so, today. </span><a href="https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/all-about-quartz-countertops"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quartz counters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> mimic granite and marble so well that the differences are sometimes hard to detect. Because the pattern and color is not just on the surface, quartz slabs can be as thick — or as thin — as you wish. Trendy colors are all the rage, and clean-lined quartz in black or white is a natural choice for trendy Euro-tech or pro-style kitchens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quartz countertops are available in both polished and matte finishes; they never need sealing, and they are heat-resistant and well as impervious to stains, cuts, warping and tears. They do not require any sort of underlayment, and they are completely hygienic, requiring cleaning only with soap and water. They may also be formed with integral sink basins and other custom features.</span></p>
<p><b>Choosing Between Laminate and Quartz</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The decision to go with quartz or laminate depends on your needs. Laminate is a bargain choice if you are looking for good looks and durability. It also comes in virtually limitless colors and styles to give you solid colors, the look of different stones or even wood. If you are willing to pay a higher price, however, quartz makes for an upscale and nearly indestructible countertop.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know that the best way to dress for cool, damp and windy days is to layer on the clothing, right? In addition to wearing a shirt and sweater, most of us add a windbreaker to help keep away drafts. Even if temperatures don’t drop into the frigid zone, it’s a smart way to protect against chills.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same is true for your home. If your energy bills soar when autumn gives way to the cold and wind of winter, why not consider adding some extra layers of protection? With simple, low-cost weatherizing home fixes, you’ll not only boost your comfort quotient, but almost certainly save money. You’ll also be doing your share for the environment by reducing your energy use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is particularly true in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s brownstones and triple deckers. These historic buildings are beautiful, but if the weatherization hasn’t been updated in a while, then you could be using a lot more energy than necessary.</span></p>
<p><b>Air Leaks and Inadequate Insulation May Be Costing You</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In older buildings like brownstones and triple deckers, there are lots of places that air can be escaping if the weatherization hasn’t been updated in a while. Be sure to check all of the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check the weatherstripping around windows and exterior doors. Replace it if necessary.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caulk and seal around any plumbing pipes, water lines, ductwork or electrical conduit that penetrates, walls, ceilings or floors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insulate heating and water lines in a basement or under sinks, especially if they’re on the north or east side of the house.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you feel drafts near light switches or receptacles, remove the plates and install foam pads behind them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make certain your interior wood trim has no visible gaps; repair or seal trim work as needed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check kitchen and bath exhaust fans for proper function. You don’t want to hear rattles or wind whistles.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your dryer vent and hose clean, unblocked and working well. Replace your furnace filter for efficiency’s sake.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have single-pane windows and no storm windows, even modern window film will help alleviate drafts and keep warm air in. Hang thermal drapes for an extra layer of warmth.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Repair plaster cracks on interior walls and do some detective work to find other gaps and air leaks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up is your insulation. In older <?php echo $row['country']; ?> homes, unfortunately,&nbsp; wall insulation may not be up to modern standards. In attic spaces, loose insulation might have settled, or there may be none under the eaves. Batt insulation can be added easily, even though it might not be a DIY project. If the wall cavities of your historic home are currently filled only with insulating sheets of old newspaper, investigate modern ways to blow in fiberglass, cellulose or cotton insulation.</span></p>
<p><b>Replacement Windows and Doors Can Save Big</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In older homes around <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, windows can be a huge source of heat and energy loss—and modernized windows can remedy that. According to the EPA, American homes on average can save $126 to $456 per year replacing dated single-pane windows, and $27 to $111 replacing double paned windows. If your brownstone or triple decker has older windows, particularly single paned windows, then it’s time for an upgrade!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same is true for doors, though to a lesser extent. Older doors can let heat out in the winter if they’re not well insulated whereas replacing your entry doors with modern, insulated versions can help you cut heating costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this, also be sure to insulate properly around windows and doors. Frames are a likely spot for air leaks, so it’s worth taking moldings down and filling any voids that you find with insulation.</span></p>
<p><b>Consider a Professional Energy Audit</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A self-assessment of your home will really help in finding air leaks and inefficiencies—but if you want to maximize energy efficiency, then consider a professional</span><a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/weatherize/home-energy-audits"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">home energy audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An auditor will be able to come in using devices like infrared cameras and blower doors to do a room-by-room assessment of your home and pinpoint inefficiencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, our <?php echo $row['name']; ?> team can answer your questions and offer advice, and we’ll be only too happy to help you find ways that go easy on your budget! The good news is that upping the R-value of your insulation adds value to your home as well. Finally, if you’re building new or planning an addition or renovation project, talk with your contractor about the importance of sealing, weatherizing, R-value and energy efficiency. It’s as smart a move for keeping cool in the summer as it is for staying warm in the winter.</span></p>
