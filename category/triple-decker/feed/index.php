With energy-efficient windows, not only will you reduce your bills, but you will also save money in the long run and get a better return on your investment.</p>
<p>
So, why is having energy-efficient windows important and what factors determine quality energy-saving windows?</p>
<h3>Why is Energy Efficiency Important? </h3>
<p>Older windows usually allow air in and out of your house through small cracks or inefficient glass—this makes your cooling and heating system work overtime to maintain a comfortable temperature, which means higher bills.<br />
Lucky for you, solving this problem is easy with new windows. When you choose energy-efficient windows for your home, you get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
1.	<strong>Comfort</strong>. Minimizing air leakage <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/noise-reduction-windows-assist-with-sound-control/">reduces noise</a> and unwelcome drafts and improves home comfort.<br />
2.	<strong>Reduced carbon footprint</strong>. New innovative glass options limit CO2 usage, resulting in smaller environmental impact. Go green!<br />
3.	<strong>Lower bills</strong>. Your HVAC system does more work when there is air leakage to compensate the temperature. Stop straining your system and save money!</p>
</ul>
<p>Energy efficiency in any home is essential, especially if you’re looking to save money and reduce your carbon footprint. We’ve covered why energy efficiency is important—but what makes a window energy efficient and what are your best options?</p>
<h3>What Makes a Window Energy Efficient? </h3>
<p>To keep your home cool in the summer and warm in the winter, a good energy efficient window will minimize escaped air through the frame and glass and regulate heat transfer and light through the window. It’s more than just the number of panes—the material of your windows will determine its energy efficiency.</p>
<h4>Glass </h4>
<p>Energy-saving glass is accomplished by the type, style, and thickness of the glass. The main factors you should consider when buying new windows are:</p>
<ul>
•	<strong>Low-E glass coating</strong>. <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/E-coating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Low-emissivity glass coating</a> can reflect solar heat—this keeps your home cooler in the summer and warm in the winter.<br />
•	<strong>Insulated glass</strong>. An extra layer of insulation is always a plus for temperature control and thermal performance!<br />
•	<strong>Panes</strong>. Yes, the number of panes do matter. Double-pane glass will insulate your home better than single-pane. If you’re looking to really improve your energy efficiency, we recommend looking into <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/triple-pane-windows-vs-double-pane-for-boston-home/">triple-pane glass</a>.
</ul>
<p>Temperature control is vital to saving energy—make sure the windows you buy have all the necessary features to ensure quality thermal performance.</p>
<h4>Frames </h4>
<p>Like any other home product, window frames can be made from various types of materials. The type of material will determine your window’s thermal resistance. For example, wood and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/fiberglass-vs-vinyl-windows-for-your-boston-residential-home/">fiberglass frames</a> offer excellent insulation by letting minimal air into your home. </p>
<h4>Installation </h4>
<p>Window installation plays a bigger part in saving energy than you might think—proper installation can make or break your energy efficiency. If the window doesn’t fit right or is installed incorrectly, even the best windows will lack in thermal performance. When buying new windows, always make sure you have quality installation. </p>
<h3>Which Window is the Best Choice for Me? </h3>
<p>Energy efficiency is the goal when buying new windows, but the location you live in depends on what you should look for in a window.</p>
<p>In a climate like <?php echo $row['country']; ?> with cold winters and hot summers, you need windows that will balance cooling and heating. To learn more about what window is best for your climate, talk with your local window expert and pay attention to <a href="https://www.nfrc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFRC</a> and <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/building_products/residential_windows_doors_and_skylights/benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENERGY STAR</a> labels.</p>
<p><h3>Increase Energy Efficiency in Your Home with <?php echo $row['name']; ?> Windows </h3>
<p>The window-buying process is full decisions—from energy-efficiency and aesthetics to installation, every decision you make will be central to temperature control in your home. </p>
<p>
At <?php echo $row['name']; ?> , we carry a wide variety of energy-efficient windows with different features, design, and more. To learn more about your options and how <?php echo $row['name']; ?> can help with your window project, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/contact-us/">give us a call today</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/x6wT35D1AFqYZEf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop by our <?php echo $row['country']; ?> showroom</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in an era in which people are becoming more conscious of health. When considering how to live a healthy lifestyle, people tend to think of diets, exercise, and sleep. One aspect of health that often gets overlooked is the home. Having a healthy home is essential, and this is especially important now that people are spending more time at home than ever. Here are 11 ways you can build a home with wellness architecture.</p>
<h2><strong>Wellness Architecture Ideas for Your <?php echo $row['country']; ?> Home, Triple Decker, Brownstone or Condo</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Allow More Natural Light</strong></h3>
<p>Bright rooms can help lift your spirits on a bad day, whereas a dark and dreary room will only make you feel worse. To ensure maximum <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/natural-light-to-your-boston-renovation/">natural light</a> in your home, your most-used rooms should have large windows, more than one if possible. Looking out on scenic landscapes or city skylines is a bonus, but any view with plenty of access to sunlight is good.</p>
<h3><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Bedrooms Designed for Better Sleep</strong></h3>
<p>Your bedroom can be designed to optimize your sleep by reducing sound and light when it’s time to go to bed. To reduce sounds from outside the bedroom, use rubber weatherstripping to seal the gap beneath your door, or place a large piece of furniture such as a dresser against an outside-facing wall. You can even add soundproof curtains or soundproof wallpaper. To manage the lighting, make sure your curtains are thick enough to block out any city lights.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Include automatic faucets</strong></h3>
<p>Hands-free faucets are more hygienic than traditional faucets because you don’t have to worry about touching the sink if your hands are dirty. This is more important than ever now during the pandemic.</p>
<h3><strong>4. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Use Healthy Paints</strong></h3>
<p>Painting a room gives it a touch of personality, but you should make sure your paints do not contain harmful chemicals such as VOCs. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/low-voc-paint-and-no-voc-paint-1976533" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.thespruce.com/low-voc-paint-and-no-voc-paint-1976533">VOCs</a> are volatile organic compounds that give off harmful gasses, and these build up inside homes. They can cause health problems such as headaches, nausea, irritation in your throat or lungs, or even damage to the liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Paint with low or no VOCs are a healthier option, but you should check to make sure they do not contain any other toxic chemicals.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Invest in Good Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p>A proper ventilation system cycles indoor air and outdoor air, improving circulation and air quality in your home. The ventilation system in your home should be checked and cleaned regularly by an HVAC technician to ensure it is working effectively.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Reduce Outdoor Noises</strong></h3>
<p>Your home should be relaxing, and the last thing you need is to constantly hear cars and shouting from outside. A home with thick walls can better block out these external sounds, allowing you to work and have fun in peace. You can also install <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/triple-pane-windows-vs-double-pane-for-boston-home/">double-glazed windows</a>, which are windows with two panes of glass separated by a small air pocket in between. Not only will this help with noises, but they also keep the warmth inside for longer, making frosty <?php echo $row['country']; ?> winters more bearable.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Grow Indoor Plants</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bioadvanced.com/articles/5-benefits-houseplants" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.bioadvanced.com/articles/5-benefits-houseplants">Indoor plants</a> add a touch of the outdoors to your home while naturally purifying your air. They also increase the humidity in your room by releasing water, which helps reduce respiratory illnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>8. Improve Kitchen Air Quality</strong></h3>
<p>People don’t often consider range hoods when thinking about kitchen appliances, but the range hood is essential to keeping the air in your kitchen clean. The exhaust removes smoke, pollutants, and excess heat from your cooking. It also makes your kitchen easier to clean by removing grease, preventing a buildup that could lead to contamination by bacteria or mold.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Use Environmentally Friendly Materials</strong></h3>
<p>By making sure your home uses eco-friendly building materials, you help make the world just outside your house a healthier place. Drywall, the most common type of interior wallboard, is made by a process that consumes a lot of energy, contributing to high CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. Luckily, there are <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/eco-friendly-drywall-options/" data-cke-saved-href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/eco-friendly-drywall-options/">drywall options</a> with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. You can even use drywall made from agricultural waste.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Install Sensors for Air Quality</strong></h3>
<p>Smoke detectors are critical in every home, but a carbon monoxide detector is equally important. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm">Carbon monoxide poisoning</a> can be fatal, and since the gas is colorless and odorless, it can be hard to know when it is building up in your home without a detector.</p>
<h3><strong>11. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Add a Fitness Space</strong></h3>
<p>Because of the pandemic, many gyms are closed and people may not feel safe going back to the ones that are open. In order to maintain a healthy exercise regimen, set up a dedicated place in your home for fitness. You can buy equipment or clear some space for a yoga mat, whatever works best for you.</p>
<p>Try any of these ideas and see what works for you. By creating a healthier home, you’ll be happier spending your time inside your house.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, lumber prices have skyrocketed. According to the</span><a href="http://nahbnow.com/2018/01/softwood-lumber-prices-climb-to-record-highs/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">National Association of Home Builders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, prices went up by 30% between Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 and January 2018. At the time, this price was higher than any prices on record since NAHB started keeping such records in 1995. March of 2018 saw lumber futures climb even higher, over $520 per 1,000 board feet, up from January’s numbers, which climbed between $420 and $460 per 1,000 board feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These days? Although the reasons for it have changed, lumber prices are still soaring higher and higher. Today, these higher prices are in large part due to the <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/how-has-covid-19-affected-lumber-prices/">pandemic creating chaos throughout markets</a>.</span><a href="http://nahbnow.com/2020/09/escalating-lumber-prices-hamper-home-owner-dreams/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">New numbers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the National Association of Home Builders shows that since mid-April of 2020, lumber prices have risen by 130%, and those increased costs have increased the cost of single-family homes more than $16,000 on average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these thoughts in mind, here are some of the causes of these rising costs—and a quick look into the future concerning both lumber prices and how these prices will affect housing costs.</span></p>
<h2><b>Why are Lumber Prices High?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of factors coming together all at once to affect lumber prices. Over the past few years, demand has increased dramatically while supply has tightened. For starters, growth of gross domestic product in all major economic regions of the world is fueling something of a world-wide construction boom. In the U.S. alone, single family home construction increased 7% between January 2017 and January 2018.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the pandemic, the amount of lumber being used in construction continues to rise. Surprisingly, housing starts are up, showing an increase of about 17% between May and July. With that, other areas are placing demand on the lumber industry. More DIYers are doing projects like decks so that they have a place to get outside during these troubled times, and restaurants across the U.S. are using more and more lumber to build outdoor seating and dining areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the lumber industry has faced</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">struggles of its own</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with shutdowns and a decreased demand for timber in other areas, like paper manufacturing and home goods, where downturns have been steep. All of this is combined with the fact that several years ago, the U.S. raised import duties on <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/canadian-lumber-tariffs-for-boston-building-industry/">Canadian lumber,</a> which has been causing a supply shortage in the U.S. as Canada exports less lumber southward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pandemic aside, there are also the rising costs of everything going into lumber production—labor, transportation, containers and so on, all costing more across the board, which drives up the cost of lumber regardless of supply or demand. The cost of a flatbed truck to haul lumber, for instance, went up 24% between January 2017 and January 2018.</span></p>
<h2><b>Where are Lumber Prices Right Now?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases, lumber prices have doubled and tripled over the past year. OSB board prices, for example, were three times higher in September 2020 compared to September 2019. Other prices have gone way up, too. Western SPF 2x4s, for example, have gone up 158% over the past year, studs have risen 164%, and southern pine has gone up 147%.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will Lumber Prices Stay High?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in 2018, experts were saying that with the current chaos in the lumber markets, prices were expected to be high through 2020. After that, costs were expected to come down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that COVID-19 is here to stay, however, things have become much more unpredictable. In order for prices to come down, several things need to happen. In the U.S., lumber production will need to increase to cover the lost supply from Canada or Canadian import duties will need to come down so that Canada can export more lumber to the United States. Shutdowns within the lumber industry will need to come to an end, and timber producers will need to increase the amount they’re producing in order to bring costs down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once these things start to happen, lumber prices should fall—but when that may happen depends on when life will return to “normal,” and no one knows when that might happen or how quickly lumber prices may fall when it does happen.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Does This Affect Housing Costs?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a builder, the rising lumber costs aren’t necessarily bad news. Of course, the higher price means that not only are housing costs going up, but mortgage costs are rising as well. The cost of single-family homes has risen by $16,000 on average—but the good news is that buyers are very willing to pay that higher price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back in January 2017 and January 2018, housing starts were up all over the country—7% among single family homes. Between May and July of 2020, housing starts went up by an incredible 17% across the country. This number is down about 4% over 2019 numbers, but it still reflects that buyer confidence is high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the reason for housing remaining steady despite the pandemic is that mortgage rates are at all time lows. In July, average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages dipped beneath 3%, which is the first time rates have gone so low since Freddie Mac started to track this data in the 1970s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lumber prices are up, astronomically so compared to prices over the last two decades, but they are expected to come down as the pandemic eases. Meanwhile, a high demand for new construction, particularly single-family homes, means that builders in the United States should quite easily be able to weather the volatile lumber market for the foreseeable future.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In terms of siding, fiber cement is a relative newcomer to the market. Wood, brick and even things like vinyl siding have all been around for quite a while, but fiber cement siding was introduced about 35 years ago. Since then, it’s been steadily growing in popularity for a variety of reasons. Companies like<a href="https://www.jameshardie.com/"> James Hardie</a> produce this type of siding, which offers a wonderful alternative to wood, vinyl and similar siding materials. If you want to learn more about why fiber cement is quickly becoming the siding material of choice, read on and we’ll show you!</p>
<h3><strong>1. Fiber Cement Replicates the Look of Wood Without the Hassle</strong></h3>
<p>Wood siding can be problematic in humid climates, prone to moss, mildew and rot. Plus there is insect damage to contend with, too. Cracking, warping and splintering are common problems with wood, and it needs to be repainted and maintained more than most other types of siding, including fiber cement.</p>
<p>Fiber cement, on the other hand, stands up to moisture very well, and it won’t rot, crack or splinter. It’s a thick, durable material that allows manufacturers to make deep grooves in its surface. This means that above all other wood lookalikes, fiber cement is the siding alternative that offers the most realistic look. In fact, some historic districts approve fiber cement siding because it looks just like the real thing.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Fiber Cement is Non-Combustible</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you need to meet area fire codes or you are building in an area where wildfires are a concern, this type of siding is a great option because it won’t ignite when exposed to direct flame. It’s also a great alternative if melted vinyl siding is a potential problem. Sometimes vinyl can melt or warp in high temperatures, which can occur when windows, especially low-E windows, reflect onto the siding.</p>
<h3><strong>3. It’s a Versatile Siding Material</strong></h3>
<p>Fiber cement panels that replicate the look of wood are a popular choice, but there are even more options available. Not just panels, but also siding that replicates lapped siding as well as shingles and blocks. There are lots of finishes available, too—painted, stained or primed so you can add your own color, or raw so that you can tailor finish it according to the project’s needs.</p>
<h3><strong>4. It’s the Easiest Way to Achieve that Coveted Modern Look</strong></h3>
<p>Sleek modern styles are all the rage in exteriors these days, often featuring color-blocked siding to make a bold statement. It’s difficult to achieve this look with other types of siding, but fiber cement panels make it easy to create that blocky, colorful look.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Affordability</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best things about fiber cement is that compared to wood or aluminum siding, it’s very affordably priced. It does cost more than vinyl, which is generally the cheapest option, but it comes with a much longer lifespan plus low maintenance costs, which offset the initial installation cost. Where things like painting are concerned, if you choose factory finished fiber cement, the paint can last up to twenty years. Even when it does need to be repainted, or if the homeowner simply desires to change colors, that paint will last longer than on wood because fiber cement doesn’t warp, expand, shrink, blister or crack.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Fiber Cement is Eco-Friendly</strong></h3>
<p>One drawback to fiber cement is that right now, there aren’t recycling programs that handle it. However, because this building material lasts decades, it causes less waste than other types of siding that need to be replacement. What’s more, it’s an inert building material, free of toxins and problematic chemicals, which means that in landfills, it doesn’t leech harmful chemicals into the environment.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying out fiber cement siding, our <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/design-center/">downtown <?php echo $row['country']; ?> design center</a> stocks James Hardie products.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of questions swirling around about the future economy, particularly in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. What will be coming in 2020? If you’re a developer or involved in construction, here are a few things you’ll need to know and how predictions could affect our <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/beantown-has-become-boom-town-for-developers/">booming beantown</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Business Owners have a Bleak Outlook</strong></h3>
<p>Recent surveys in Massachusetts show that business owners are hunkering down for the coming year. In October 2019, <a href="https://blog.aimnet.org/aim-issueconnect/massachusetts-companies-wary-of-economic-downturn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://blog.aimnet.org/aim-issueconnect/massachusetts-companies-wary-of-economic-downturn">Associated Industries of Massachusetts</a> reported that a full two-thirds of survey respondents not only expected an economic slowdown for 2020, but a contraction. Already, Massachusetts is seeing the effects of this, with employers hesitant to hire, fewer purchases being made, and extra inventory liquidated.</p>
<h3><strong>But the Construction Market Shows Otherwise</strong></h3>
<p>Business owners bracing for impact—that’s one side of the picture. On the other end of things, in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it looks as through the construction sector will continue to grow in 2020. Data from <a href="https://ccorpinsights.com/regional/<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://ccorpinsights.com/regional/<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/">Cumming Insights</a> shows where construction is expected to remain steady, and where it will keep growing.</p>
<p>According to their predictions, the housing market will stay steady, showing no growth for the year. However, the tech industry within <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is booming. With the rising demand for tech, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/2019-boston-real-estate-development-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction growth</a> will shift to this sector. In fact, tech growth is expected to be a major driving force behind <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s economy during 2020. This is because there are lots of things supporting this growth—proximity to Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, plus plenty of start-ups providing jobs for new residents flocking to the city. There are also several major tech corporations expanding within Massachusetts, including Verizon, Apple and Google.</p>
<p>Things like hospitality and gaming are growing, with new hotels and casinos opening. With the population rising and unemployment low throughout the city, it’s expected that sectors including healthcare, education and manufacturing could grow to meet the city’s demands.</p>
<h3><strong><?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s Industry is Recession-Proof, But the Housing Market?</strong></h3>
<p>Economists believe that by 2022, the United States will have entered another recession. <?php echo $row['country']; ?> itself is expected to stay strong throughout largely because of major industries that just keep growing. Often during a recession, the housing market enters a downturn along with the rest of the economy, with home prices falling. But experts believe that <?php echo $row['country']; ?> may be different in this regard. Because of the industry keeping new residents flocking to the city, and because of the scarcity in available homes within <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, prices are expected to remain high.</p>
<p>And what about new residential construction? Contractors will continue to build new homes and condos, of course, but there may not be much growth, if any, in this part of the construction sector. That’s in large part because homebuyers will feel the hit to their wallets. Inflation will go up, raising the cost of living, while housing prices remain high, which reduces the average individual’s buying power.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Construction Trends to Look for in <?php echo $row['country']; ?></strong></h3>
<p>It’s a safe bet that construction will grow across health, education and tech industries. But what about other construction markets?</p>
<p>Public transit may be a big industry to look at in 2020. This is because with housing prices remaining high, residents are flocking away from the more expensive districts nearer to their workplaces. The result is longer commutes, congested traffic, and a strain on public transit systems. Construction may grow in this area simply to help alleviate these issues.</p>
<p>Zoning changes, if approved by local lawmakers, could also drastically shift the construction picture in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Right now, lots of <?php echo $row['country']; ?> areas are zoned against multi-family development projects. However, lawmakers are already starting to shift. For example, in Somerville and Cambridge, there are proposals being considered that would allow for affordable housing in the areas.</p>
<p>Flexible co-working spaces may be another trend for developers to look out for. The growing number of startups means that these new businesses need flexible spaces to expand. Currently, there are more than 3.7 million square feet of co-working spaces within <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, and that’s a number that could grow as this trend continues.</p>
<p>Overall, while some reports paint a bleak picture of business contraction and a looming recession, <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is a resilient city with strong industries that will continue to hold steady no matter what the economy does. What does this mean for developers and contractors? It means that there will always be work—but the focus may shift away from things like housing or retail and more toward tech and office space.</p>
<p>Our building materials business is <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/located-in-the-heart-of-the-boston-building-boom/">located in the heart of <?php echo $row['country']; ?></a> and continues to assist developers and contractors in building <?php echo $row['country']; ?> whether the project is residential, commercial or mixed use.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Skylights come in all shapes and sizes, with all sorts of great advantages! But are they right for your <?php echo $row['country']; ?> home? Start by assessing what your home needs—and be sure to consider the drawbacks, too. We’ll show you where the best places to add skylights are, and what types of skylights are available for you to try.</p>
<h3><strong>Reasons to Consider Skylights</strong></h3>
<p>There are lots of great reasons to install skylights in your home. First and foremost, they’re a great way to <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/design/decorating/design-101/let-the-sun-shine-in-with-skylights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase the home’s interior lighting</a>. If you’re looking to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/natural-light-to-your-boston-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">increase light</a>, look at either tubular skylights or go with larger skylights, especially if the shafts from roof to room will be long.</p>
<p>Skylights are good for ventilation, too. They’ll let out excess moisture on humid days, and when it’s hot outside, you can open up the skylights to vent heat away from the home.</p>
<p>One unanticipated benefit to skylights is that they’ll increase your home’s value. They’re an attractive feature that buyers are willing to pay extra for—and on average, homeowners only spend about $1,500 to install them!</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LU5M_gFkmRg?rel=0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3><strong>What are the Drawbacks?</strong></h3>
<p>While there are a lot of benefits to skylights, there are also a couple of drawbacks that you should be aware of before making the decision to install them. On sunny days, for instance, you may find that skylights let in a little too much light—though this is something that can be remedied by installing skylights with blinds. And, like any windows, they can make your home a little less <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/5-questions-answered-about-energy-efficient-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">energy efficient</a>. Although, this is another thing that can be mitigated by choosing well sealed, highly insulated skylights.</p>
<h3><strong>Where Should You Add Skylights?</strong></h3>
<p>Skylights in and of themselves are a great reason to remodel, and if you’re already remodeling certain rooms, then now is the opportunity to get a little more light into these spaces. Most rooms in the home will benefit from skylights. Bathrooms and bedrooms, for example, will enjoy lots of extra natural lighting—but the skylights keep these spaces private, too. In the kitchen or other workspaces, skylights are helpful for providing additional illumination. They’re a good choice in the attic, too, especially if it’s a converted attic. Here, skylights are generally more easily accessible, and they can be designed to play an important role in your home’s ventilation.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2544 size-large" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Guide-to-Choosing-Skylights-400x600.png" alt="" width="400" height="600"></p>
<h3><strong>What Types of Skylights are Available?</strong></h3>
<p>There are all kinds of different types of skylights available. The type that you choose will be based on your home’s needs. Browse through products like those <a href="http://www.veluxusa.com/products/sun-tunnels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offered by Velux</a>, and you’ll see all the skylights listed below and more!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed Skylights:</strong>&nbsp;As the name suggests, these skylights are fixed in place so that they have a tight seal with the roof. They can’t be opened, and their main purpose is to add illumination to rooms.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilated Skylights:&nbsp;</strong>These skylights can be opened, which means they give you both light and fresh air.</li>
<li><strong>Curb Mounted Skylights:</strong>&nbsp;With double-walled insulation, curb skylights are the most energy efficient type of skylight. They are excellent at preventing air leaks, which helps keep heat inside the home.</li>
<li><strong>Tubular Skylights:</strong>&nbsp;Conical in shape, these skylights—like the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.veluxusa.com/products/sun-tunnels" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sun Tunnel lights from Velux</a>—are the best for increasing interior light. They feature parabolic lenses and a reflective tube to capture light, maximize it, and shine it into the room.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Skylights:</strong>&nbsp;Skylights come in all shapes and sizes, so feel free to take a look around at custom designs! There are pyramid-shaped lights, barrel vaulted lights, skylights to fit on a home’s ridge, and more, each made to add not only a source of light and ventilation, but also a unique architectural aesthetic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Skylights are a valuable addition to any home. Consider each factor carefully, and check out all the types of skylights available to choose a product that suits your home’s needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for summertime project ideas? There are lots of summer home renovation ideas that are best done during a warmer month, and these projects come in all shapes and sizes! Here are a few ideas to fit all budgets!</p>
<h2><strong>The Big Projects</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. Multi-Room Projects</strong></p>
<p>If you plan to remove walls between your kitchen, living and dining areas to open up the space or do some other large, multi-room project, then warm, dry weather makes life easier as you haul debris outside and bring new building materials indoors.</p>
<p><strong>2. Full Room Remodels</strong></p>
<p>Again, summer is the best time to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/boston-gut-renovation-not-for-the-faint-heart/">gut a room</a> back to bare studs. You’ll want to be able to open windows for ventilation, and builders will be moving between indoors and outside quite a lot as they haul lumber, drywall and new fixtures into your home!</p>
<p><strong>3. Flooring Projects</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you’re thinking of <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/choose-right-flooring-for-boston-triple-decker-remodel/">installing</a> brand new hardwoods, or perhaps you’d like new carpet, tile or linoleum. Summertime means you can open up windows to ventilate your home as adhesives, grout or new finishes dry on your fresh new floors.</p>
<p><strong>4. Siding Replacement</strong></p>
<p>Spring and fall winds and rain are big concerns if you plan to completely replace your home’s siding, and this isn’t a project you’ll want to tackle in cold weather, either, since siding affects the building’s envelope.</p>
<p><strong>5. Window Replacement</strong></p>
<p>If you noticed drafts over the winter or if you’re looking to make <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/5-questions-answered-about-energy-efficient-windows/">energy efficiency improvements</a> to your windows, now is the time to do it! Window replacement in the summer means you won’t have to deal with heat loss as new windows are being installed.</p>
<p><strong>6. Driveway Repairs</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re looking at installing fresh concrete or repaving your driveway, this is one job that must be done in the summer so that the paving materials cure properly!</p>
<h2><strong>Mid-Range Renovation Ideas</strong></h2>
<p><strong>7. Install an Outdoor Kitchen</strong></p>
<p>What better time to create the outdoor kitchen of your dreams? Get started by checking out ideas for&nbsp;<a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-tips-for-choosing-weatherproof-outdoor-cabinets/" data-cke-saved-href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-tips-for-choosing-weatherproof-outdoor-cabinets/">weather-resistant outdoor cabinetry!</a></p>
<p><strong>8. Make a Deck Upgrade</strong></p>
<p>If you already have a deck, but it needs <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-factors-to-guide-your-decision/">new decking boards</a> or other improvements, this is a great summer project. And if you don’t have a deck, this is a good chance to build one.</p>
<p><strong>9. Bathroom Remodeling</strong></p>
<p>Bathroom <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/bring-the-beach-home-6-coastal-themed-bathroom-ideas/">projects</a> can take many forms, from new fixtures to new floors, windows or a fresh coat of paint. Warm weather lets you ventilate the space and helps caulk, sealant and other essentials dry properly.</p>
<p><strong>10. New Paint for the Siding and Exterior Fixtures</strong></p>
<p>If the exterior of your home needs a fresh coat of paint (but not a full replacement), then wait for a warm, dry stretch to ensure the new paint dries flawlessly!</p>
<p><strong>11. Landscaping Upgrades</strong></p>
<p>There are few better ways to improve your home’s curb appeal! New flowerbeds, new trees and shrubs and improvements to your lawn can all be on your summer checklist.</p>
<p><strong>12. Turn Your Rooftop Deck into an Oasis</strong></p>
<p>In busy cities like <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/build-the-boston-roof-deck-of-your-dreams/">roof decks</a> are a great place to escape for some fresh air. Consider new flooring and décor to turn your roof deck into a summertime getaway.</p>
<p><strong>13. Install or Repair Your AC</strong></p>
<p>With summer on the way, now is the time to be thinking about a new air conditioning unit—or making sure your current A/C is ready to go for hot weather!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2539 size-large aligncenter" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/18-home-renovation-ideas-for-summer-400x600.png" alt="" width="400" height="600"></p>
<h2><strong>Smaller Renovations</strong></h2>
<p><strong>14. Install Ceiling Fans</strong></p>
<p>Need to get a breeze going indoors? Install ceiling fans in strategic places to keep cool air circulating.</p>
<p><strong>15. Try New Cabinet Hardware</strong></p>
<p>New cabinet hardware is a simple and highly effective way to breathe life into a kitchen or bathroom’s design! For a popular new finish, check out&nbsp;<a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/blush-gold-kitchen-hardware-vs-polished-chrome-kitchen-hardware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/blush-gold-kitchen-hardware-vs-polished-chrome-kitchen-hardware/">blush gold hardware.</a></p>
<p><strong>16. Re-stain Your Deck</strong></p>
<p>This is another one of those summertime essentials because the balmy weather will help the stain cure effectively—plus make the task easier, too!</p>
<p><strong>17. New Interior Paint</strong></p>
<p>If you’re ready for a dose of new colors throughout the home, this is one possibility to consider since you’ll be able to open up the windows to let out that new paint smell!</p>
<p><strong>18. Install New Entry Doors</strong></p>
<p>This is an easy, inexpensive job that serves a couple of purposes: It upgrades the look and feel of your home, and it helps you improve energy efficiency, too!</p>
<p>Summertime means there are lots of options to choose from. Any of these renovations will help make your home an even more beautiful place to spend the warmer months!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The multi panel slide door is one of those items that is starting to the top of so many homeowner wishlists! Companies like&nbsp;<a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/discover-jeldwen-doors-windows-<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/" data-cke-saved-href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/discover-jeldwen-doors-windows-<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/">Jeld-Wen</a>&nbsp;are rising to the occasion by producing beautiful sliding patio doors that fit a variety of needs and home styles. There is a lot to love about these doors, so if you’re thinking about getting in on this trend, here are a few reasons why <?php echo $row['country']; ?> homeowners adore these doors!</p>
<h3><strong>1. The Indoor-Outdoor Connection</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you have a big patio, a <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/7-small-patio-makeover-ideas/">beautiful backyard</a> or a seaside view, the connection between the indoors and the outdoors that you can make with a large patio door is a benefit that cannot be overlooked. Not only does a large sliding door make interior spaces more welcoming by providing a beautiful view, but it also makes your living space feel more expansive, too. That’s not to mention all the extra sunlight you’ll be letting into the room, along with the ease of access to your outdoor spaces.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Multi-Slide Doors are Versatile</strong></h3>
<p>Many think of these doors as best suited to modern homes, which would mean that perhaps they aren’t best suited to historical buildings like <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/repairs-and-upgrades-that-triple-decker-owners-want/"><?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s triple deckers</a>. However, if you look through offerings from Jeld-Wen, Marvin and LaCantina, you’ll find these doors in a variety of styles and finishes. What’s more, most have a clean, simple look, which means that they blend easily with a variety of home styles—but you’ll also find multi-slide doors in French and other traditional styles. Just check out the casing options on these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvin.com/marvin/doors/scenic-multi-slide?view=features-options&amp;option=casing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.marvin.com/marvin/doors/scenic-multi-slide?view=features-options&amp;option=casing">Marvin multi-slide doors</a>&nbsp;to see what we mean! Typically, these doors come in a variety of sizes and configurations, too, which means that no matter what size the opening available for a new door, you’ll be able to find something that fits.</p>
<h3><strong>3. The Modern Multi Slide Panel Door is Energy Efficient</strong></h3>
<p>In the past, large patio doors meant sacrificing energy efficiency, especially in climates like <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s, where the winters are cold and the summers are hot. But these days, a good multi slide door comes with several features to make sure that your energy bills stay low. Vinyl, aluminum or wood-clad aluminum frames offer plenty of insulation, and weather stripping seals away drafts. Doors like those offered by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lacantinadoors.com/products/sliding-doors/multi-slide/aluminum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.lacantinadoors.com/products/sliding-doors/multi-slide/aluminum">LaCantina</a>&nbsp;also come with low U-factors and low solar heat gain coefficients. This is in large part due to multiple panes of glass and argon gas in between the pains to help reduce thermal transfer—although with some doors, thermal coatings are also available to reduce heat gain on sunny days, too.</p>
<h3><strong>4. These Doors are Durable Against the Elements</strong></h3>
<p>Homeowners nowadays are looking for maintenance-free options to make keeping up with home repairs easier. Most of today’s multi-panel doors have very low maintenance requirements. This is because modern materials—especially vinyl and aluminum, which are two of the most popular frame choices—don’t require any upkeep. No sanding, refinishing or repainting for the life of the door!</p>
<h3><strong>5. Sliding Doors Make the Most of Limited Space</strong></h3>
<p>Traditional patio doors fold open, which means that no matter how many doors you install, the largest opening will only be as large as two paired doors—and when open, those doors intrude on the living space. Sliding doors allow for a much larger opening, particularly if you have a three or four-track system that allows you to stack doors while open. Moreover, these doors can be installed so that they’re pocketed, which means that you can slide them into the walls to either side of the opening for an even larger entry.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are lots of great reasons to consider a multi panel slide door. Even in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s harsh weather, these doors will let you enjoy a beautiful view without sacrificing heat in the winter or the A/C in the summer.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When homeowners think of porches, they usually think of traditional homes. But the truth is, lots of homes, even in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, have plenty of porch space to work with! This goes for both homes in more traditional styles, and modern condos, too. If you’re looking for modern front porch ideas that will work complement an <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/modernize-the-historic-urban-environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">urban lifestyle</a> in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, here are a few contemporary porch options to consider!</p>
<p><span id="more-2511"></span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Try Privacy&nbsp;<span class="wsc-grammar-problem" data-grammar-phrase="Screens" data-grammar-rule="PUNCTUATION_PARAGRAPH_END" data-wsc-lang="en_US">Screens</span></strong></h3>
<p>In an urban setting, privacy is often a concern! You want to enjoy the comfort of your front porch, but you don’t necessarily want to look at the neighbors—or have them looking at you. Privacy screening is a great upgrade that serves double duty as both decoration and a way to make your porch a little more cozy. There are lots of options, including traditional screens, or for something a little fancier try a wood or <a href="https://www.woodwayproducts.com/products/lattice-screen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latticework screens</a> from Woodway products still gives you a view while at the same time shielding the porch’s occupants from sight.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Consider Glass Railing for a Sleek Look</strong></h3>
<p>For a true contemporary design, glass porch <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/choose-the-right-railing-system-for-boston-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">railing</a> will give you a smooth, sleek look—and it won’t obstruct the view. Modern glass rails are shatter-proof, which means they serve as safety railing in addition to decoration, and they come in lots of styles. Full glass panels will give you a smooth, clean look while glass slats soften the contemporary design a little bit by adding a slightly more traditional style to the railing.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Metal Rails are Popular, Too</strong></h3>
<p>If you’re not a fan of the glass look, then think about using metal railings instead. <a href="https://www.rdirail.com/homeowner/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RDI railing products</a> have popular modern front porch railing option that can be designed to suit a variety of home styles. Choose wrought iron or simple metal bars for more traditional homes. For more contemporary homes, cable railings are both popular and stylish.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Upgrade Your Porch’s Pillars</strong></h3>
<p>Porch columns are often overlooked in favor of railings and décor, but the right columns can completely remake the look of the porch. Craftsman homes look amazing with square columns and rounded or scrolled pillars work well with homes that have more classical styling. Narrow square or round pillars can help you build on a contemporary look, too. For more ideas, check out some of the options at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hbgcolumns.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HB&amp;G Columns</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-2509 size-large" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8-Contemporary-porch-ideas-that-complement-urban-living-400x600.png" alt="8 Contemporary porch ideas that complement urban living" width="400" height="600"></p>
<h3><strong>5. Don’t Forget Post Caps!</strong></h3>
<p>Not all porch columns go floor-to-ceiling. For porches with shorter posts, you’ll definitely want to choose post caps that complement your overall theme. These can range from simple finials that give the post a square, finished look to elaborate caps that feature scrolling and replicate the look of fine woodwork.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Consider Lighting Carefully</strong></h3>
<p>Where lighting is concerned, there are lots of options to consider. Overhead lights keep the porch bright and beautiful at night, and there are lots of options to consider, including can lights, pendants and even themed chandeliers. Lights to either side of the door make a front porch feel welcoming. Contemporary homes sometimes place lighting lower—on the porch rails, for instance. These days, you can even purchase post caps fitted with LED lights that provide a stylish, modern source of illumination.</p>
<h3><strong>7. What about Flooring?</strong></h3>
<p>Flooring is another thing you’ll want to keep in mind. Depending on the look you’re going for, options range between wood (or wood lookalikes) on traditional porches while contemporary porches can work well with wood, concrete or even stone and ceramic tiles.</p>
<h3><strong>8. Don’t Skimp on Furnishings!</strong></h3>
<p>Once you’ve chosen railings, columns, colors and flooring, the next step is to choose furnishings that go with the theme you’ve created! Porches are comfortable places, designed to while away the afternoon or evening in comfort. Definitely go with cozy armchairs, and if you have the space, maybe even a sofa. End tables selected to suit the home’s style will give you a place to set drinks or the book that you’re reading, and you may even add little extras like a small fire pit, candles or other bits of décor to amp up that restful feeling even more!</p>
<p>Front porch design is all about creating a welcoming, comfortable place to visit with friends or enjoy a beautiful afternoon or evening. Choose some of these ideas as you upgrade your porch, and you’ll be able to create a cozy space even in an urban environment!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, where small backyards are the norm, so are small patios! With spring on the way, most homeowners will be looking at makeover ideas in order to get their patio spruced up and ready for summer. If you need some inspiration, here are a few of our favorite ideas!</p>
<p><span id="more-2499"></span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Get a Little Lift by Converting the Patio to a Deck</strong></h3>
<p>Small <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/which-is-the-best-decking-material-treated-wood-vs-composite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decks</a> are great places to spend the afternoon with a good book or even host small summertime barbecues. They’re advantageous, too, in that they remove the need for you to walk down a short flight of steps to get to the patio, which is handy when you’re carrying food or other dinner party necessities from indoors to outside. With the addition of some furniture, perhaps a bar or maybe even an outdoor fireplace, it’s totally possible to turn a small deck or patio into a beautiful, comfortable outdoor living room. Just check out <a href="https://www.trex.com/inspiration/gallery/bigstyleinsmallspaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.trex.com/inspiration/gallery/bigstyleinsmallspaces/">Trex’s gallery of small decks</a>&nbsp;to see what we mean!</p>
<h3><strong>2. Turn Your Patio into an Outdoor Kitchen</strong></h3>
<p>Just because space may be limited, that doesn’t mean you don’t get to have an outdoor kitchen! It’s perfectly possible, even with a small patio, to create a kitchen with plenty of functionality. Start with a cabinet manufacturer like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.naturekast.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.naturekast.com/">NatureKast</a>&nbsp;to find durable, weatherproof cabinetry, and design your small-space <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-tips-for-choosing-weatherproof-outdoor-cabinets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outdoor kitchen</a> with efficiency in mind. For instance, you can install cabinets beneath a built-in grill to give you both storage and a place to barbecue!</p>
<h3><strong>3. Focus on Comfort</strong></h3>
<p>Small patios by nature have a cozy feeling, and this is something you can enhance further with clever furniture choices. To create a lounge-like atmosphere, go with low furniture—low-slung chairs, cushions and seating options directly on the ground, and so forth. Or, you can capture the cabana kind of feeling with a couple of comfy hammocks.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Go for Green</strong></h3>
<p>Small patios have a big advantage in that they’re easy to surround in plenty of beautiful foliage. In fact, lots of homeowners use small trees and shrubs to create a kind of living wall around the patio to ramp up that comfortable, natural feeling. Invest in a few large planters, and you’ll find that it’s easy to create your own little backyard hideaway.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Make Your Patio Cozy at Night, Too</strong></h3>
<p>Patios aren’t just for enjoying the sunshine. They’re a great place to enjoy the cool evening air, too. If you have the space, try a small firepit. Otherwise, tiki lamps, candles, blankets and other creature comfort needs are an ideal way to cuddle up outdoors after dark!</p>
<h3><strong>6. Make a Statement with Furniture</strong></h3>
<p>You may think it’s tough to decorate such a small space because there just isn’t much room for a lot of extras. But, if you place a focus on the furniture, you can definitely create a specific mood, even if you don’t have a lot of room for planters, tables and décor. Depending on the styles you like, there are lots of options you can choose. In general, though, you’ll want to look for things like chairs and small tables that double not only as seating and useful surfaces, but eye-catching parts of the décor, too.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Go Big on Theme</strong></h3>
<p>No matter what theme you choose for your small patio, the best way to make it over is to choose a theme and tie into it as much as possible. So, for example, if you want a cabana-style theme, then don’t just stop at wicker chairs and a hammock! Add some tropical foliage, tiki lamps and all the rest of the details to really make your patio feel like a tiny getaway spot.</p>
<p>Even in busy cities like <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it’s possible to create a small oasis! Use these ideas to give your patio a makeover, and you’ll find yourself enjoying it all summer long!</p>
