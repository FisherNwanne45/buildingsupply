<p>
In an already busy city that continues to grow, developers and builders are building up instead of out, limiting space for consumers. So, what does this mean for your kitchen remodel? How do you maximize the small space you have to make it feel and look bigger?</p>
<h2>Keep It Compact</h2>
<p>Many manufacturers offer small appliances for areas with limited space, like 24-inch-deep refrigerators. Another pro tip to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/kitchen-layout-ideas-for-every-home/">maximize your kitchen space</a> is to hang small appliances such as microwaves to save counter space. </p>
<h2>A Successful Center</h2>
<p>A common misconception of small kitchen design is that you should leave the middle of your space open to make it feel more spacious. However, this is not the case—maximize the space you have by putting in a <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/the-pros-and-cons-of-a-kitchen-island-for-your-boston-home/">permanent or roll-away island</a> for storage and prep space.</p>
<h2>The Glass Illusion</h2>
<p>Fun fact: glass cabinet fronts lighten the look of cabinets because of their transparency, making the kitchen seem more expansive. This can also act as an opportunity to display your pretty statement pieces such as wine glasses, bowls, or china. </p>
<h2>Expand Your Storage</h2>
<p>There are often storage issues for small kitchen appliances, utensils, and decorations in small kitchens. Minimize clutter and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/6-must-have-kitchen-cabinet-organizers-and-accessories-2/">expand storage space</a> by installing deep cabinets, drawers, and countertops. You can also get cabinet and drawer inserts to help with organization.</p>
<h2>Merge &#038; Maximize</h2>
<p>If you have an open floorplan, an easy way to maximize your kitchen space is by overflowing your kitchen into a bigger space like your living room or combining the two. A great way to do this is to put a small table and chairs in your kitchen to combine the kitchen and “dining room” or use your counter or island as a bar area. </p>
<h2>Get Rid of Clutter</h2>
<p>Messy and cluttered rooms often make a space look smaller—minimize overcrowded shelves and countertops to make the space look bigger. Choose which items you want to display in the open and hide the rest in the pantry, drawers, and cabinets.</p>
<h2>Open It Up</h2>
<p>Open shelving such as glass cabinets or floating shelves not only improve visuals and aesthetics, but they also reduce visual weight with a sleek look while acting as storage for kitchen accessories. You can also decorate your shelving with plants, photos, or other décor.</p>
<h2>Consistent Colors</h2>
<p>Matching the paint color of your cabinets and wall color will erase the visual boundary created by two different colors in a small space. If you’ve hopped on the <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/9-tips-for-two-tone-kitchen-cabinets-in-a-small-kitchen/">two-tone cabinet</a> bandwagon, it’s a good idea to choose two colors that are close in shade with only a subtle difference.</p>
<h2>Bigger Isn&#8217;t Always Better</h2>
<p>Usually, you’ll choose furnishings that will fill your space, but in the case of a small kitchen, don’t. The floorspace of small room is valuable, so don’t waste it with a big table or island. Instead, opt for sleek and thin pieces to limit physical and visual bulk. </p>
<h2>Clean Is Key</h2>
<p>If you’re a <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/minimalist-kitchen-design-tips-for-boston-homeowners/">minimalist</a>, designing a small kitchen is right in your wheelhouse. For those who prefer more decorations and details, try to keep these aspects limited and only show them off in a select few places—clean lines will create a roomier feel. </p>
<h2>Design to Expand &#038; Impress with <?php echo $row['name']; ?> </h2>
<p>In the wake of COVID-19, home renovations have never been more popular. When leaving in a high-rise apartment or condo in the heart of downtown <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it might seem like your options are limited—however, there are many ways to expand the feel of your space if you work with the right products.</p>

Between working from home and stay-at-home orders, homeowners have been spending more time at home and rethinking their home’s design features.</p>
<p>
One trend that is popular for 2021 is kitchen remodels—while vacations get postponed due to travel restrictions and events cancelled for health concerns, many are putting their money into new kitchen countertops.</p>
<h2>Accent Countertop Trends </h2>
<p>Accent countertops are all the rage in 2021—whether it’s a traditional veined quartz, a modern orange, or a sleek black slab, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/kitchen-islands-add-pop-of-color-to-design-scheme/">countertops and islands</a> have become the focal point in the kitchen. Here are a few accent countertop trends that you won’t want to miss in this year’s remodel.</p>
<h3>1. Veined Quartz </h3>
<p>Quartz and other stone materials have always been a popular and constant countertop trend for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
•	Quartz is stain-resistant;<br />
•	Quartz is hygienic;<br />
•	Quartz is durable; and<br />
•	Quartz is low maintenance.
</ul>
<p>Because of its consistent popularity, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/quartz-continues-to-latest-kitchen-countertop-trend/">quartz accent countertops</a> are now offered in a wide range of colors, patterns, and finishing techniques to meet any aesthetic. Veined quartz in particular is a great way to give your kitchen the wow factor without straying too far from a natural and traditional look.</p>
<h3>2. Color Pops </h3>
<p>If you’re more into the modern look and want to make a statement, a pop of color in your kitchen is the way to go. </p>
<h4>Black is Back </h4>
<p>One of the most sought-after looks is a sleek black stone countertop in contrast with striking white cabinets and brass fixtures. Another great use of <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/want-in-on-the-matte-black-kitchen-trend-6-ideas-to-help-you-pull-it-off/">black in the kitchen</a> achieves the rustic look: black accent countertops paired with rustic wood features. Either way you to choose to use it, black is certainly back.</p>
<h4>Go Bold &#038; Bright </h4>
<p>Others may be looking to make more of a splash with their interior design choices, choosing brightly colored countertops. After almost 50 years, orange and green have circled back into the kitchen remodel world and we’re here for it. If you want to liven up a monochromatic kitchen, make a statement with bold and bright accent countertops.</p>
<h3>3. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle </h3>
<p>Recycled glass countertops are quickly climbing their way to the top of homeowners’ kitchen visions, offering a way to reduce your carbon footprint while wining and dining in style. Choose from eco-friendly countertops made of recycled glass and white cement in a variety of colors to add sustainable elegance to your home. </p>
<h3>4. Industrial Interiors </h3>
<p>Concrete accent countertops are a new trend in the kitchen world—yes, we did say concrete—that are also gaining momentum. Many homeowners love the industrial look that concrete countertops bring to their kitchen, meeting the ongoing demand for an Urban aesthetic. What was once drab concrete is now a slab of art full of flecks of color ready to capture your attention!</p>
<h2>Kitchen Trends</h2>
<p>Now that you know which accent countertops are trending, it’s time to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/design-center/">design your kitchen</a>. Here are a few popular kitchen trends for 2021 that you won’t want to miss:</p>
<ul>
•	<strong>L-shaped layout</strong>. L-shaped kitchens are especially good for smaller homes or downtown <?php echo $row['country']; ?> apartments.<br />
•	<strong>Open floorplan</strong>. Supervise your kids and entertain guests while cooking with an open kitchen floorplan.<br />
•	<strong>Glass doors</strong>. Homeowners love an opportunity to showcase wine glasses and other accent pieces while protecting them from dust.<br />
•	<strong>Brushed and matte finishes</strong>. Not only are brushed finishes easier to clean, but they also serve as a great compliment to accent countertops.<br />
•	<strong>Statement backsplashes and ventilation hoods</strong>. Squares, hexagons, diamond, and other fun shapes can turn your kitchen into a statement.
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0" class="mce_SELRES_start"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>﻿</span>Aesthetics and look are always important features when shopping for new windows, but energy efficiency is your top priority. With energy-efficient windows, not only will you reduce your bills, but you will also save money in the long run and get a better return on your investment.</p>
<p>
So, why is having energy-efficient windows important and what factors determine quality energy-saving windows?</p>
<h3>Why is Energy Efficiency Important? </h3>
<p>Older windows usually allow air in and out of your house through small cracks or inefficient glass—this makes your cooling and heating system work overtime to maintain a comfortable temperature, which means higher bills.<br />
Lucky for you, solving this problem is easy with new windows. When you choose energy-efficient windows for your home, you get the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
1.	<strong>Comfort</strong>. Minimizing air leakage <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/noise-reduction-windows-assist-with-sound-control/">reduces noise</a> and unwelcome drafts and improves home comfort.<br />
2.	<strong>Reduced carbon footprint</strong>. New innovative glass options limit CO2 usage, resulting in smaller environmental impact. Go green!<br />
3.	<strong>Lower bills</strong>. Your HVAC system does more work when there is air leakage to compensate the temperature. Stop straining your system and save money!</p>
</ul>
<p>Energy efficiency in any home is essential, especially if you’re looking to save money and reduce your carbon footprint. We’ve covered why energy efficiency is important—but what makes a window energy efficient and what are your best options?</p>
<h3>What Makes a Window Energy Efficient? </h3>
<p>To keep your home cool in the summer and warm in the winter, a good energy efficient window will minimize escaped air through the frame and glass and regulate heat transfer and light through the window. It’s more than just the number of panes—the material of your windows will determine its energy efficiency.</p>
<h4>Glass </h4>
<p>Energy-saving glass is accomplished by the type, style, and thickness of the glass. The main factors you should consider when buying new windows are:</p>
<ul>
•	<strong>Low-E glass coating</strong>. <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/E-coating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Low-emissivity glass coating</a> can reflect solar heat—this keeps your home cooler in the summer and warm in the winter.<br />
•	<strong>Insulated glass</strong>. An extra layer of insulation is always a plus for temperature control and thermal performance!<br />
•	<strong>Panes</strong>. Yes, the number of panes do matter. Double-pane glass will insulate your home better than single-pane. If you’re looking to really improve your energy efficiency, we recommend looking into <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/triple-pane-windows-vs-double-pane-for-boston-home/">triple-pane glass</a>.
</ul>
<p>Temperature control is vital to saving energy—make sure the windows you buy have all the necessary features to ensure quality thermal performance.</p>
<h4>Frames </h4>
<p>Like any other home product, window frames can be made from various types of materials. The type of material will determine your window’s thermal resistance. For example, wood and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/fiberglass-vs-vinyl-windows-for-your-boston-residential-home/">fiberglass frames</a> offer excellent insulation by letting minimal air into your home. </p>
<h4>Installation </h4>
<p>Window installation plays a bigger part in saving energy than you might think—proper installation can make or break your energy efficiency. If the window doesn’t fit right or is installed incorrectly, even the best windows will lack in thermal performance. When buying new windows, always make sure you have quality installation. </p>
<h3>Which Window is the Best Choice for Me? </h3>
<p>Energy efficiency is the goal when buying new windows, but the location you live in depends on what you should look for in a window.</p>
<p>In a climate like <?php echo $row['country']; ?> with cold winters and hot summers, you need windows that will balance cooling and heating. To learn more about what window is best for your climate, talk with your local window expert and pay attention to <a href="https://www.nfrc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFRC</a> and <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/products/building_products/residential_windows_doors_and_skylights/benefits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ENERGY STAR</a> labels.</p>
<p><h3>Increase Energy Efficiency in Your Home with <?php echo $row['name']; ?> Windows </h3>
<p>The window-buying process is full decisions—from energy-efficiency and aesthetics to installation, every decision you make will be central to temperature control in your home. </p>
<p>
At <?php echo $row['name']; ?> , we carry a wide variety of energy-efficient windows with different features, design, and more. To learn more about your options and how <?php echo $row['name']; ?> can help with your window project, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/contact-us/">give us a call today</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/x6wT35D1AFqYZEf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop by our <?php echo $row['country']; ?> showroom</a>. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Condos are a big part of the <?php echo $row['country']; ?> lifestyle. In a city hemmed by the ocean on one side, with a <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/solutions-for-building-more-housing-units-in-<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/">shortage in available housing units</a>, developers are building upwards instead of outwards—and that means apartment-style condos are rising in popularity. What does the interior design look like? There are lots of trends emerging for 2021. Here are some of our favorites!</p>
<h2><strong>1. Lighting as Much for Decoration as Illumination</strong></h2>
<p>This is a big trend that will be growing more popular in 2021. Whether through lamps or carefully selected chandeliers, lighting serves a dual purpose in the modern condo. It’s meant to both illuminate and decorate, usually through creative designs and finishes that make light fixtures catch the eye. While recessed lighting will still be popular, statement pieces to accompany them are also the norm—and they’re typically strategically placed in order to not only be eye catching but to highlight certain parts of the room to which you’d like to draw attention. For example, in bathrooms, concealed lighting behind mirrors or beneath the vanity serves to not only light up the bathroom but also add a bit of style, too.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Color Schemes Favor Light and Fresh</strong></h2>
<p>Modern apartment design—particularly in places like <?php echo $row['country']; ?> where interior spaces might be smaller than average—focuses on keeping finishes light colors. This comes with a big advantage in that light colors reflect a lot of light, which makes rooms feel more spacious. White is a timeless classic that will always be in style, and for 2021, it’s also looking like cool light gray tones will be popular, too.</p>
<h2><strong>3. Black and White Color Schemes Will be Popular, Too</strong></h2>
<p>Black and white color schemes have been trendy for a while—as illustrated by the continuing popularity of things like tuxedo kitchens. This is expected to remain true for 2021, although in condos and smaller spaces, the current trend emphasizes using small amounts of black to pick out details among white and light gray color schemes. This can mean black stools at a gray kitchen island or black pendant lighting in a room designed in shades of white and gray.</p>
<h2><strong>4. Minimalism in Design and Décor</strong></h2>
<p>This trend is expected to become a big one for 2021, and for much the same reasons why light colors are becoming more popular. Minimalism focuses on using fewer elements, usually simplistic in design, to decorate and furnish interior spaces. People love it for the clean, classic look—and also because this design style by default minimizes a cramped or cluttered feeling, which is a huge plus when you want to make smaller spaces feel bigger and more open.</p>
<h2><strong>5. Functional Rooms Overtake Formal Rooms</strong></h2>
<p>One trend that is fading, particularly in condos, apartments and other smaller dwellings, is the idea of the formal room. This means that things like formal living rooms or formal dining rooms are on the way out. The trend that is replacing these spaces? Functional areas that are useful every day and not just when entertaining. Expect more eat-in kitchens or living rooms that combine family entertainment along with a cozy place to host your friends.</p>
<h2><strong>6. Closed Storage is Making a Comeback</strong></h2>
<p>In recent years, open storage has been extremely trendy. This means things like shelving where the contents stored on those shelves are as much decorative as they are functional. In kitchens, the old trend included glass doors or open shelves that displayed dishes, mugs and other useful items. Today, however, the concept of closed storage is coming back. This means that rather than making your tools, dishes and other useful things part of the décor, designers will be looking at ways to install cabinets and other hideaway storage fixtures in order to keep clutter confined behind closed doors.</p>
<h2><strong>7. Cottagecore is the New Buzzword</strong></h2>
<p>With so many people staying at home these days, a surprising new trend has emerged, it it’s one that will continue to grow throughout 2021. It’s called “cottagecore” and it’s all about making interior spaces cozy and artistic. To pull off the look, designers are using vintage elements like carefully chosen antiques as well as comfortable throws, pillows and other textiles to create spaces that invite relaxation.</p>
<h2><strong>8. Easy Cleaning is Key</strong></h2>
<p>This is perhaps another trend borne of the pandemic. More people staying at home means more cooking at home and more making messes at home. With that, many are concerned with the ability to sanitize and disinfect easily. People are looking more and more for surfaces that are easy to clean. This means high gloss in the kitchen, smooth floors that can be mopped in a minute, and uncomplicated designs that won’t require hours to scrub bits of dirt out of nooks and crannies.</p>
<h2><strong>9. Closed Floor Plans are Back in Style</strong></h2>
<p>Open floor plans were huge for a long while, particularly in apartments and condos where space was already limited. The idea was that opening up the kitchen, living and dining areas gave all three a bigger sense of space. Here again, however, the new stay at home and work from home lifestyle has caused a shift in trends. With the kids home all the time, and with work happening in the home office, people are looking for more privacy—and that means walling off some areas of the home in order to get a break from others and to limit distractions.</p>
<p>The past year has caused a lot of changes to our lifestyles, and that is definitely reflecting in condo design trends for 2021. However, there are still a few classic trends—like minimalism and color schemes—that will be rising in prominence, too. The things listed above are likely to be the big ones for the coming year!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in an era in which people are becoming more conscious of health. When considering how to live a healthy lifestyle, people tend to think of diets, exercise, and sleep. One aspect of health that often gets overlooked is the home. Having a healthy home is essential, and this is especially important now that people are spending more time at home than ever. Here are 11 ways you can build a home with wellness architecture.</p>
<h2><strong>Wellness Architecture Ideas for Your <?php echo $row['country']; ?> Home, Triple Decker, Brownstone or Condo</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Allow More Natural Light</strong></h3>
<p>Bright rooms can help lift your spirits on a bad day, whereas a dark and dreary room will only make you feel worse. To ensure maximum <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/natural-light-to-your-boston-renovation/">natural light</a> in your home, your most-used rooms should have large windows, more than one if possible. Looking out on scenic landscapes or city skylines is a bonus, but any view with plenty of access to sunlight is good.</p>
<h3><strong>2. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Bedrooms Designed for Better Sleep</strong></h3>
<p>Your bedroom can be designed to optimize your sleep by reducing sound and light when it’s time to go to bed. To reduce sounds from outside the bedroom, use rubber weatherstripping to seal the gap beneath your door, or place a large piece of furniture such as a dresser against an outside-facing wall. You can even add soundproof curtains or soundproof wallpaper. To manage the lighting, make sure your curtains are thick enough to block out any city lights.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Include automatic faucets</strong></h3>
<p>Hands-free faucets are more hygienic than traditional faucets because you don’t have to worry about touching the sink if your hands are dirty. This is more important than ever now during the pandemic.</p>
<h3><strong>4. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Use Healthy Paints</strong></h3>
<p>Painting a room gives it a touch of personality, but you should make sure your paints do not contain harmful chemicals such as VOCs. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/low-voc-paint-and-no-voc-paint-1976533" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.thespruce.com/low-voc-paint-and-no-voc-paint-1976533">VOCs</a> are volatile organic compounds that give off harmful gasses, and these build up inside homes. They can cause health problems such as headaches, nausea, irritation in your throat or lungs, or even damage to the liver, kidneys, and nervous system. Paint with low or no VOCs are a healthier option, but you should check to make sure they do not contain any other toxic chemicals.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Invest in Good Ventilation</strong></h3>
<p>A proper ventilation system cycles indoor air and outdoor air, improving circulation and air quality in your home. The ventilation system in your home should be checked and cleaned regularly by an HVAC technician to ensure it is working effectively.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Reduce Outdoor Noises</strong></h3>
<p>Your home should be relaxing, and the last thing you need is to constantly hear cars and shouting from outside. A home with thick walls can better block out these external sounds, allowing you to work and have fun in peace. You can also install <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/triple-pane-windows-vs-double-pane-for-boston-home/">double-glazed windows</a>, which are windows with two panes of glass separated by a small air pocket in between. Not only will this help with noises, but they also keep the warmth inside for longer, making frosty <?php echo $row['country']; ?> winters more bearable.</p>
<h3><strong>7. Grow Indoor Plants</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.bioadvanced.com/articles/5-benefits-houseplants" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.bioadvanced.com/articles/5-benefits-houseplants">Indoor plants</a> add a touch of the outdoors to your home while naturally purifying your air. They also increase the humidity in your room by releasing water, which helps reduce respiratory illnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>8. Improve Kitchen Air Quality</strong></h3>
<p>People don’t often consider range hoods when thinking about kitchen appliances, but the range hood is essential to keeping the air in your kitchen clean. The exhaust removes smoke, pollutants, and excess heat from your cooking. It also makes your kitchen easier to clean by removing grease, preventing a buildup that could lead to contamination by bacteria or mold.</p>
<h3><strong>9. Use Environmentally Friendly Materials</strong></h3>
<p>By making sure your home uses eco-friendly building materials, you help make the world just outside your house a healthier place. Drywall, the most common type of interior wallboard, is made by a process that consumes a lot of energy, contributing to high CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions. Luckily, there are <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/eco-friendly-drywall-options/" data-cke-saved-href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/eco-friendly-drywall-options/">drywall options</a> with lower CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. You can even use drywall made from agricultural waste.</p>
<h3><strong>10. Install Sensors for Air Quality</strong></h3>
<p>Smoke detectors are critical in every home, but a carbon monoxide detector is equally important. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.cdc.gov/co/faqs.htm">Carbon monoxide poisoning</a> can be fatal, and since the gas is colorless and odorless, it can be hard to know when it is building up in your home without a detector.</p>
<h3><strong>11. </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Add a Fitness Space</strong></h3>
<p>Because of the pandemic, many gyms are closed and people may not feel safe going back to the ones that are open. In order to maintain a healthy exercise regimen, set up a dedicated place in your home for fitness. You can buy equipment or clear some space for a yoga mat, whatever works best for you.</p>
<p>Try any of these ideas and see what works for you. By creating a healthier home, you’ll be happier spending your time inside your house.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><?php echo $row['country']; ?> offers so many condo options that it can be hard to choose between them. One differentiating factor among condo options is the amenities. Whether it’s a gym, rooftop pool, or a lounge with games, different condos offer varying sets of amenities. Here are some of the most useful and fun amenities today’s <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo owners are interested in.</span></p>
<p><b>Rooftop Amenities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a city like <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, homes with rooftop recreation features where you can relax and admire the view are popular. A rooftop garden can provide much-needed greenery in an urban location. Other rooftop features might include swimming pools, a bar, fire pits, and more. These amenities might be closed for the time being due to the pandemic, but the rooftop can still serve as a great place to spend time with your condo friends in a socially distant way. It can provide valuable respite from being cooped up inside all day.</span></p>
<p><b>Fitness Facilities</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having easy access to fitness facilities is especially important in today’s health-conscious era. This can include equipment such as treadmills and weights, as well as sports areas such as a tennis or basketball court. Time is precious for working professionals, so why drive out to a gym when you can access the same equipment right where you live? A condo’s fitness facilities offer the convenience of being only a few minutes’ walk from your doorstep, and they usually don’t charge costly membership fees required by a standard gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although your condo’s fitness facilities may be closed due to the pandemic, this is only temporary. Once it’s safe to reopen gyms, you can be certain that the condo’s fitness facilities will be in high demand.</span></p>
<p><b>Environmentally Friendly Features</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s homeowners are not only health-conscious, but also environmentally conscious. Environmentally friendly features in a condo are especially important now that people are spending much more time at home. They are a great way to save money while helping the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A condo that uses LED light bulbs, water fixtures with low flow, efficient heating and cooling systems, and windows that reduce heat loss will be appealing to an eco-friendly homeowner. Some people may go so far as to inquire about the materials used for construction. Finally, since more people are starting to switch to electric cars, car-charging stations within the condo are another appealing factor.</span></p>
<p><b>Child-Friendly Offerings</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo owners have young children, and with small children come certain needs that a condo is well-equipped to serve. Some condos may have an indoor playroom or outdoor playground, and others may even have an onsite daycare. A play area or daycare is a great way for children to make new friends who live nearby and keep themselves occupied when parents are busy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Child-friendly features are especially appealing to working parents during the pandemic, when they might struggle to manage their job while watching their children. Living in a well-equipped condo allows parents to easily meet other families and set up a babysitting schedule.</span></p>
<p><b>Pet Care</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For some <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo owners, pets are their children. People with pets are more likely to choose a condo that offers pet care services such as grooming or a private dog park. Some high-end condos might even feature pet spas, but this is less common. Since dogs still need to go out for a walk every day, spending time in a place like a private dog park can allow condo residents to meet new people during the pandemic, while feeling safer than they would in a public dog park.</span></p>
<p><b>An Appealing Interior</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s condo owners want an interior that feels clean and modern. A granite countertop can give your kitchen an elegant look, and wooden floors look more polished than carpeted floors while being easier to clean. It is also important to have spacious rooms with big windows that allow ample natural light, especially now that people are spending more time at home than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When choosing a condo, you should look for one that offers the amenities you need. Different people have different needs, but ultimately, you should choose a condo with amenities that make your life easier and more enjoyable.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are a condo owner in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, you may be thinking about renovations to make to your home. Fall is a great time to get some additions or remodeling done on your condo. As the days start getting shorter, you’ll want to make your condo as cozy and functional as possible in preparation for long winter nights. Here are a few </span><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/top-boston-renovation-projects-for-fall/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fall projects </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">you should consider for your <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo this fall.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Wall Colors</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve been living in your condo for a while, you might be tired of seeing the same walls every day. Try repainting your walls with a different color of paint or replacing the wallpaper with something fresh. To make your rooms feel cheerful and welcoming, go for colors that are bright but not too bold. You don’t even need a professional—repainting is simple enough to do on your own. Although it’s time consuming, it can serve as a fun project for the weekends.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weatherstrip Your Doors</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, people have been investing in climate-proofing their homes to protect against extreme weather patterns. Weatherstripping your doors is especially important to keep your condo warm during those cold <?php echo $row['country']; ?> winters, and it also leads to savings on your energy bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a variety of options when it comes to weatherstripping materials, each with different advantages and drawbacks. For example, rubber is the most durable, but it is also expensive and challenging to install. Weatherstripping is a simple process. Simply cut the weatherstrip into three pieces—two for the sides and one for the top—and stick them into place. Finish the project by adding a door sweep for the bottom of the door. Like repainting, this is another project you can do yourself.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade Your Bathroom Tiles</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a condo, you may not be able to move around bathroom fixtures without draining your wallet. Luckily, there are less expensive ways you can elevate your bathroom to the next level. You can update the tile and flooring for a fresh look. Small, textured tiles for your shower floor are a must-have. Not only do they look elegant, but the extra grouting and the texture help prevent slips caused by wet and soapy floors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Add Recessed Cabinets for Effective Use of Space</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><?php echo $row['country']; ?> condos can be small, so it is important to get the most out of your space. You can add a recessed medicine cabinet to your bathroom to take up less space while giving you a good amount of storage. These can be labor-intensive to install, but they offer an elegant look to your bathroom and go well with any bathroom design, whether it’s traditional or modern.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maximize Your Kitchen Storage</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen has one of the biggest storage requirements of all the rooms in your condo. Even if your kitchen is small, there are ways to make the most of wasted space. If your condo has a banquette, install drawers or shelves below the seating to maximize your use of floor space. For your kitchen cabinets, use soft-closing full extension drawers or increase cabinet sizes to reduce unused wall space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also add toe-kick drawers. The toe-kick is the space between the bottom of your lower cabinets and the floor, and it is there for ergonomic reasons. By adding toe-kick drawers, you create more space while maintaining the ergonomics of your kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Add Technology to Your Bathroom</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also turn your bathroom into a</span><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/take-your-boston-bathroom-to-new-heights/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">technological hub</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. No more straining to hear your phone over the water—add a water-resistant speaker to listen to music while you shower. Installing a waterproof TV into your bathroom wall can help you unwind after a long day with a hot bath and good show. Finally, you can install LED lights in your shower or tub. These cycle through different colors, creating a fun and calming atmosphere.</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>&nbsp;Install Energy Efficient Windows</b></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-window-replacement-questions-to-ask-for-your-historic-renovation/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Window replacements</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both wood and vinyl, made the list among the top ten best upscale improvements that you can make. Once you’ve seen all of the new advancements in energy efficient window technology, such as better window coatings and glazes, lower air leakage rates, and more, you won’t be surprised by this improvement’s high ranking.</span></p>
<h3><b>8. Upgrade the Lighting</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The days are getting shorter, which means that you’ll get a lot of mileage out of new lighting. Today, buyers and owners alike are looking for bright, even lighting — although you can always install dimmer switches in key areas like the living room or bedrooms. Recessed lighting will make up the bulk of your new design, but don’t hesitate to add in a chandelier here or there as a statement piece.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This remodel is one that will certainly require a permit to complete. Of course, if any of the other <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo renovation ideas that we have mentioned end up as extensive renovations, then you may need a permit for those as well, but for the windows, it is a certainty. You may want to check out our </span><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/want-to-step-up-your-home-improvement-contractor-relationship-read-this-first/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">post about contractor relationships</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where we discuss the types of relationships you can have, and the contractor’s responsibility, which includes obtaining the necessary permits.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Get started with any of these ideas to improve the look and function of your condo. If you are planning to sell your property in the future, these renovations can also make your condo more attractive to potential buyers. With these upgrades, you’ll look forward to spending comfortable fall and winter days in your home.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of questions swirling around about the future economy, particularly in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. What will be coming in 2020? If you’re a developer or involved in construction, here are a few things you’ll need to know and how predictions could affect our <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/beantown-has-become-boom-town-for-developers/">booming beantown</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Business Owners have a Bleak Outlook</strong></h3>
<p>Recent surveys in Massachusetts show that business owners are hunkering down for the coming year. In October 2019, <a href="https://blog.aimnet.org/aim-issueconnect/massachusetts-companies-wary-of-economic-downturn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://blog.aimnet.org/aim-issueconnect/massachusetts-companies-wary-of-economic-downturn">Associated Industries of Massachusetts</a> reported that a full two-thirds of survey respondents not only expected an economic slowdown for 2020, but a contraction. Already, Massachusetts is seeing the effects of this, with employers hesitant to hire, fewer purchases being made, and extra inventory liquidated.</p>
<h3><strong>But the Construction Market Shows Otherwise</strong></h3>
<p>Business owners bracing for impact—that’s one side of the picture. On the other end of things, in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it looks as through the construction sector will continue to grow in 2020. Data from <a href="https://ccorpinsights.com/regional/<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://ccorpinsights.com/regional/<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/">Cumming Insights</a> shows where construction is expected to remain steady, and where it will keep growing.</p>
<p>According to their predictions, the housing market will stay steady, showing no growth for the year. However, the tech industry within <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is booming. With the rising demand for tech, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/2019-boston-real-estate-development-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction growth</a> will shift to this sector. In fact, tech growth is expected to be a major driving force behind <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s economy during 2020. This is because there are lots of things supporting this growth—proximity to Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, plus plenty of start-ups providing jobs for new residents flocking to the city. There are also several major tech corporations expanding within Massachusetts, including Verizon, Apple and Google.</p>
<p>Things like hospitality and gaming are growing, with new hotels and casinos opening. With the population rising and unemployment low throughout the city, it’s expected that sectors including healthcare, education and manufacturing could grow to meet the city’s demands.</p>
<h3><strong><?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s Industry is Recession-Proof, But the Housing Market?</strong></h3>
<p>Economists believe that by 2022, the United States will have entered another recession. <?php echo $row['country']; ?> itself is expected to stay strong throughout largely because of major industries that just keep growing. Often during a recession, the housing market enters a downturn along with the rest of the economy, with home prices falling. But experts believe that <?php echo $row['country']; ?> may be different in this regard. Because of the industry keeping new residents flocking to the city, and because of the scarcity in available homes within <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, prices are expected to remain high.</p>
<p>And what about new residential construction? Contractors will continue to build new homes and condos, of course, but there may not be much growth, if any, in this part of the construction sector. That’s in large part because homebuyers will feel the hit to their wallets. Inflation will go up, raising the cost of living, while housing prices remain high, which reduces the average individual’s buying power.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Construction Trends to Look for in <?php echo $row['country']; ?></strong></h3>
<p>It’s a safe bet that construction will grow across health, education and tech industries. But what about other construction markets?</p>
<p>Public transit may be a big industry to look at in 2020. This is because with housing prices remaining high, residents are flocking away from the more expensive districts nearer to their workplaces. The result is longer commutes, congested traffic, and a strain on public transit systems. Construction may grow in this area simply to help alleviate these issues.</p>
<p>Zoning changes, if approved by local lawmakers, could also drastically shift the construction picture in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Right now, lots of <?php echo $row['country']; ?> areas are zoned against multi-family development projects. However, lawmakers are already starting to shift. For example, in Somerville and Cambridge, there are proposals being considered that would allow for affordable housing in the areas.</p>
<p>Flexible co-working spaces may be another trend for developers to look out for. The growing number of startups means that these new businesses need flexible spaces to expand. Currently, there are more than 3.7 million square feet of co-working spaces within <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, and that’s a number that could grow as this trend continues.</p>
<p>Overall, while some reports paint a bleak picture of business contraction and a looming recession, <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is a resilient city with strong industries that will continue to hold steady no matter what the economy does. What does this mean for developers and contractors? It means that there will always be work—but the focus may shift away from things like housing or retail and more toward tech and office space.</p>
<p>Our building materials business is <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/located-in-the-heart-of-the-boston-building-boom/">located in the heart of <?php echo $row['country']; ?></a> and continues to assist developers and contractors in building <?php echo $row['country']; ?> whether the project is residential, commercial or mixed use.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing great work with your hands? No problem. You&#8217;re a pro.</p>
<p>Drafting a contract that allows you to do that great work while protecting your interests? That&#8217;s a whole lot trickier.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t taken a good look at your standard contract in a while, now is the perfect time to give it a good once-over — <em>before </em>work heats up in the spring. In particular, make sure you have these five clauses spelled out in your contracts to protect you from the rare —&nbsp;but potentially devastating — <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/apply-these-5-tactics-to-manage-your-homebuilder-client-expectations/">problem client</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-1552"></span></p>
<h3>1. The Right to Stop Work for Nonpayment</h3>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, <a href="http://www.goldmanlg.com/uncategorized/ten-new-years-resolutions-contractors-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can&#8217;t necessarily stop construction</a> over a late or missing payment. To protect yourself from losing money&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;being on the hook for completing a job without payment, be sure to add a clause that indicates how long you&#8217;ll wait for payment before stopping work. This will cover you and give you some more leverage to request payment in a timely manner.</p>
<h3>2. &nbsp;The Right to Recoup Attorney&#8217;s Fees</h3>
<p>If you do find yourself in a situation where nonpayment has escalated, you may have to take your client to court to get your money. That&#8217;s a last resort, of course, but it&#8217;s good to be prepared. Be sure to add a clause stating that you have the right to recoup your attorney&#8217;s fees for any legal action you end up taking. If you leave this out, you&#8217;ll be out of luck — and taking your client to court may become too expensive to be worthwhile.</p>
<h3>3. The Right to Terminate for Convenience</h3>
<p>Sometimes, no matter what you do, a project isn&#8217;t going to work out. This <a href="https://www.whirlwindsteel.com/blog/bid/407862/clauses-you-need-to-include-in-your-next-construction-contract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clause gives you an out if your working relationship with the client deteriorates</a> or you can&#8217;t see eye to eye on the details of the project. A right to terminate clause will help you get out of a bad situation, and it generally offers your client the same freedom. Though it can sound a little scary to leave open the possibility of getting kicked off the job — which is vanishingly rare! —&nbsp;&nbsp;you&#8217;ll be glad for the freedom when you need it.</p>
<h3>4. The Right to Hire Subcontractors</h3>
<p>Your clients may or may not understand the ins and outs of what it takes to build a house, and they may balk at the idea of using subcontractors to complete the work. In an ideal world, you&#8217;d be able to talk them through the reasons why you&nbsp;sub&nbsp;jobs out and allay their fears about the quality of work. Still, this clause spells out that you can hire subcontractors at will, and it will protect you from unfounded complaints about doing so. Even if you don&#8217;t plan to use subs, it&#8217;s good to have this in place — you never know what will come up on a job or how you&#8217;ll have to take care of it.</p>
<h3>5. The Right to Change Orders</h3>
<p>Also in the category of &#8220;things come up&#8221; are change order clauses. Your clients will certainly want changes, but make sure that your <a href="http://www.americanbar.org/publications/under_construction/2013/january_2013/top_ten_construction_prime_contract_provisions_negotiated_owner.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contract also specifies a change order procedure when&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;need to alter something</a> on the project. This could be as simple as discovering that a door is out of stock, or it could be a complicated change to the design or specified materials. Good communication solves most problems, but it&#8217;s always good to have a back-up plan in writing so everyone knows what to expect.</p>
<p>Construction contract clauses can work for you — if you know what to look for. Add a contract review to your to-do list this year to make sure you&#8217;re up to date and ready to roll.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Navy cabinets are a major trend in <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/minimalist-kitchen-design-tips-for-boston-homeowners/">kitchen design</a> right now, and there are a few good reasons for that. This shade is a practical one, one that will last you for years. It’s a beautiful shade that is very easy to design a look around, and it’s also one that meshes well with <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/honey-bronze-color-become-an-interior-design-favorite/">other popular trends</a>. If you’re looking for reasons why you might consider this particular trend for your kitchen, we’ll elaborate more below!</p>
<div style="display: none;"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2585" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/navy-kitchen-cabinets.png" alt="navy kitchen cabinets" width="600" height="1550" srcset="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/navy-kitchen-cabinets.png 600w, <?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/navy-kitchen-cabinets-297x768.png 297w, <?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/navy-kitchen-cabinets-396x1024.png 396w, <?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/navy-kitchen-cabinets-595x1536.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></div>
<h2>
<strong>1. Navy Cabinets are Practical</strong></h2>
<p>This shade is a practical one for a couple of key reasons. First off, navy blue is a timeless, classic color. You’ll see more on this in sections to come, but in short, this is one color that will last—and stay plenty stylish—for a long time into the future. And that makes it a practical shade not only because it will keep on looking nice and fitting with trends, but also because this means that your investment won’t go to waste should you ever decide to sell your home. In the years to come, blue cabinets will be just as attractive—and thus valuable to potential buyers—as they were when you installed them.</p>
<p>It’s also a color that works well for day to day life. Kitchens are the one room in a home that sees the most abuse. Everything from pots and pans banging around to liquids and bits of food splashing can leave their mark on cabinetry. This is a shade that helps hide some of that. Whereas white or black can be difficult to keep pristine, blue is a nice moderate tone that can help hide some of that mess until you have a chance to wipe it up.</p>
<h2><strong>2. Navy Cabinets Will Stay Stylish for Years to Come</strong></h2>
<p>Some trends are a flash in the pan—here one season, gone the next. For a homeowner considering a costly remodel, this can be an intimidating thought. After all, who wants to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on an upgrade that will be out of fashion in just a year or two?</p>
<p>Navy is one of those trends you won’t have to worry about. It’s a timeless color that has always been favored by interior designers. Using it as a cabinet shade ensures that your kitchen cabinets will go the distance. Five years from now, ten years from now, they’ll still be just as in-demand as they are today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2587" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2587" style="width: 474px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-2587 size-full" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ultracraft-blue-cabinetry.jpg" alt="ultracraft blue cabinetry" width="474" height="711"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2587" class="wp-caption-text">Ultracraft Blue Cabinetry</figcaption></figure>
<p>What’s more is that these cabinets work well with a variety of styles, so you won’t have the worry of choosing an appropriate color to match whatever type of cabinetry you’ve selected. More formal cabinet styles take on a classy, elegant look with a navy finish. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/products/finishes/naval/maple" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.decoracabinets.com/products/finishes/naval/maple">rustic or classic farmhouse</a>&nbsp;kitchens, navy lends a comforting, understated feel to the atmosphere. It’s truly a color that will keep you happy no matter what you choose to do with your kitchen!

<h2><strong>3. Blue Cabinets are both Beautiful and Versatile</strong></h2>
<p>One of the best parts about this shade is that it is gorgeous and easy to use. As you saw above, it pairs well with any number of cabinet styles. This holds true for other kitchen elements, too. Navy looks beautiful with white, off-white or cream walls and floors. But it can also work with natural wood, shades of gray, or even things like stainless steel.</p>
<p>It’s a color that is known for it’s soothing qualities. Blue is often recommended for spaces meant to relieve stress, and many people see it as a traditional color.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-color-psychology-of-blue-2795815" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-color-psychology-of-blue-2795815">Color theory</a>&nbsp;says that blue brings about tranquil, calming feelings, and designers often use it not only to create these moods, but to give spaces a luxurious, high-end feeling.</p>
<h2><strong>4. This Shade Complements Other Prominent Trends</strong></h2>
<p>One of the best parts of the navy cabinet trend is that it works beautifully with other up and coming trends. Tuxedo cabinets, for example, have been in style for a while—and this is a look you can easily achieve with navy simply by choosing navy cabinets as your base, and a lighter color for upper cabinets.</p>
<p>One of the best trends to work with navy, however, is the <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/why-brass-is-back-for-kitchen-hardware/">gold hardware</a> trend. These two shades are meant to go together. Choose doorknobs, drawer pulls and other fixtures in gold to create a rich, luxurious look within your kitchen.</p>
<p>So there you have it! If you’re looking for a trend that will go the distance, something versatile enough to work with other trends like gold hardware, then navy blue might just be the way to go.</p>
