<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Durability</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">.

<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Acoustics</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. In commercial spaces, quality acoustics are essential. Wood doors are a great way to minimize noise, increase privacy, and increase productivity in large office spaces.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size"><span data-contrast="none">2022 Commercial &amp; Residential Door Trends</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></h2>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">Wooden doors offer lots of benefits—but what do they offer in terms of style choices? As we head into 2022, here are a few </span><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/window-and-door-trends-for-2020/"><span data-contrast="none">interior door trends</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to look out for to help stylize your office space.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size"><span data-contrast="none">Shapes &amp; Sizes</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">This year, interior designers and door manufacturers are putting a fun twist on doors with various shapes and sizes, often incorporating wide and tall doors into design. These oversized doors offer increased accessibility for users, more natural light (which also increases productivity!), and even creates the illusion of a bigger space while elevating your aesthetics.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">When it comes colors, door trends are all over the board: from dark and moody to light neutrals, you can’t go wrong with your color palette.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">A few of 2022’s trending interior door colors include the following:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<ul>
<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Dark stained oak</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. Black is back and better than ever with bold black, charcoal gray, and deep brown stained doors.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></li>



<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Jewel tones</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. In sharp contrast with moody blacks and browns, there has been a surge of brightly colored accent doors like emerald green and sapphire blue that make a statement.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></li>



<li><b><span data-contrast="auto">Natural neutrals</span></b><span data-contrast="auto">. If you’re a minimalist, neutrals are a great choice—beige, soft pinks, and light grays and blues never seem to go out of style.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">No matter what interior design choices you make, don’t underestimate the doors—make sure they complement your space and make a statement.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size"><span data-contrast="none">Designs</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></h3>



<p><span data-contrast="auto">In an era of contemporary looks, traditional and elaborate doors are out, and simple modern doors are in. Sleek and smooth door designs like flush doors and shaker doors are great choices for any space, especially in environments where safety, sound, maintenance, and versatility are high priorities.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Sourcing trendy and quality interior doors should be at the top of your list when planning out the design of an office space.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>When trying to nail down the details for your decking project, it can often be daunting to know where to start. What decking material do you choose? Where do you get your decking from? How do you get it to the jobsite?</p>



<p>All these questions are common for contractors when finding composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>—however, the process for building or replacing a deck and finding a good company to supply the materials can be simple if you follow these steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Find a Reputable <?php echo $row['country']; ?> Decking Company</h2>



<p>The first step of this process is to do your research and know your options—whether you use the Internet or word of mouth, your first job is to find a building materials company that sells composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> and delivers to your jobsite.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Choose Colors &amp; Materials</h2>



<p>The next step of this process is the fun part: picking out the products! Once you find a good company and sales representative to work with, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/design-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit their showroom</a> to view their decking options and get help from their design team.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Wood vs. Composite Decking</h3>



<p>One of the most common questions for decking contractors and homeowners is a big one: should you invest in <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/trex-decking-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traditional wood decking or composite decking</a>? While wood decking might seem more appealing from a cost perspective, Trex composite decking offers the following benefits:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Weather resistant</strong>. Unlike traditional wood decking, Trex composite decking doesn’t rot or warp from intense weather exposure—a nice benefit for <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s harsh winters.</li>



<li><strong>Environmentally friendly</strong>. Trex decking is made from <a href="https://www.trex.com/why-trex/eco-friendly-decking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">95% recycled materials</a> including reclaimed wood and recycled film to minimize waster and maximize sustainability.</li>



<li><strong>Low maintenance</strong>. If you’re looking for a low maintenance deck, Trex is the deck for you. With composite decking, you won’t have to worry about constant restraining, splintering, or insect damage like you do with traditional wood decking.</li>
</ol>



<p>Trex decking comes in three different lines for you to choose from: Transcend, Select, and Enhance, with different colors, sizes, pricing, and streaking available to fit your decking project needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Deck Railing</h3>



<p>Every new deck needs new railing—find a variety of styles and posts to complete your deck with Trex composite deck railing. With ADA compliance, easy configuration and maintenance, and a wide range of colors and finishes, Trex railing is the perfect choice for a stunning deck.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-h-4-font-size">Outdoor Lighting</h3>



<p>When it comes to both entertainment and relaxation on a deck, ambience and lighting are everything. Trex’s outdoor lighting line is designed to be inviting, enhance curb appeal, and highlight your deck by showing it off to visitors and neighbors while serving all your outdoor lighting needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Order Product</h2>



<p>Once your sales rep and design team have helped you find the perfect composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it’s time for one of the last steps of the process: determining size and ordering the products. When determining deck size, there are two basic rules you should follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>No section of the deck should be bigger than the biggest room in the house; and</li>



<li>The deck should not be bigger than 20% of the house’s total square footage.</li>
</ol>



<p>Begin sketching your deck design ideas on graph paper using these rules and try to imagine the deck you’re creating. Do the different deck areas flow together, or do they feel choppy and separated? Is the deck too big or too small? Do you have enough space to put furniture and move around freely? Once you decide on all the details, your sales rep will help you determine how much product you need to order.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">Jobsite Delivery</h2>



<p>It’s time for the final and most exciting step: delivery day! When working with a reputable company that sells composite decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, make sure they give you an accurate delivery timeline and include product delivery in their service offerings. Living in a big city like <?php echo $row['country']; ?> requires tall boom trucks able to reach high and navigate busy streets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">High Quality Composite Decking in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> from NEBS</h2>

<p>As winter weather and 2022 roll in, it’s time to start thinking about deck upgrades and builds in the coming months. Whether you’re researching ideas or looking for a decking contractor, now is the perfect time to start planning ahead and staying up to date on outdoor living trends.</p>



<p>Every new year brings new trends and possibilities—keep reading to learn more about how to keep your outdoor living space functional and fresh in 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">1. Maximize &amp; Modernize</h2>



<p>With quarantine and COVID-19 still hanging over our heads, interest in outdoor living space is only increasing—and we don’t expect it to go away anytime soon. Homeowners are loving bringing their home outside and <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/8-contemporary-porch-ideas-that-complement-urban-living-2/">maximizing their outdoor space</a> for both personal and party time.</p>



<p>If you have the room, why not expand? As backyards and patios become an extension of the home to relax in and entertain, homebuilders are building out with <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/summer-deck-design-trends/">modern designs</a>. Hop on the modern design trend with composite decking, neutral colors, and functional luxury.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-h-3-font-size">2. Multi-Functional</h2>



<p>Along with maximizing space, homeowners are also looking to maximize their outdoor living space’s potential by making it multi-functional for any season of the year. To use your deck year-round, try adding some of the following aspects to your outdoor living space:</p>



<ul>
<li>Firepit or fireplace for cozy winter nights;</li>



<li>Covered TV for fall football;</li>



<li><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/weatherproof-outdoor-cabinets-2/">Outdoor kitchens</a> for summer barbeques; and</li>



<li>Waterproof furniture for spring rain.</li>
</ul>



<p>You’re investing so much into your outdoor living space—why not make it functional?</p>

As stay-at-home orders and closures increased, homeowners turned their attention to <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/5-top-fall-projects-for-your-boston-condo-renovation/">home improvement projects</a> and outdoor living spaces.</p>
<p>
When building an <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/summer-deck-design-trends/">outdoor living space</a>, don’t forget the kitchen—an outdoor kitchen adds functionality, beauty, and value to your home. Weatherproof kitchen cabinets are the name of the game for an outdoor kitchen build with many different materials, colors, and designs to choose from to complete your outdoor oasis. </p>
<h2>Wood vs. PVC</h2>
<p>Just like any other kitchen, cabinets can add style and personality to your outdoor kitchen. Whether you add a pop of color to make a statement or simply want more storage, selecting the right material for your outdoor cabinets is crucial to the design and layout. </p>
<h3>Traditional Wood Cabinets</h3>
<p>Wood cabinets are not quite as durable as other materials, but there are specific types of wood that are better to use for outdoor living. A few of the woods you might want to consider are bamboo, teak, or cypress. </p>
<p>
Here are a few perks to using wood cabinets in your outdoor kitchen:</p>
<ul>
•	They have environmentally friendly options; and<br />
•	They are easy to stain and finish to match any color or design scheme.
</ul>
<p>The following are the less enjoyable aspects of using wooden cabinetry outside:</p>
<ul>
•	They require regular upkeep;<br />
•	They fade overtime from sun and other natural exposure;<br />
•	They are prone to cracking, warping, or swelling; and<br />
•	They are a more expensive material.
</ul>
<p>Wooden cabinets are prone to the same difficulties as any other wood product—however, you can lessen these potential problems with proper maintenance and quality wood materials. </p>
<h3>PVC NatureKast Cabinets</h3>
<p>We all know that living in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> comes with harsh weather—having outdoor kitchen cabinets that can endure the elements is still important. NatureKast cabinets are made from a man-made polymer plastic material built to <a href="https://naturekast.com/case-studies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tolerate any weather</a> with low maintenance. </p>
<p>
The benefits of using PVC cabinets for outdoor living include the following:</p>
<ul>
•	They are easy to clean and maintain;<br />
•	They are resistant to sun, rain, saltwater and snow;<br />
•	They do not fade or stain; and<br />
•	They are 100% weatherproof and waterproof, meaning NatureKast cabinets will not rust or rot.
</ul>
<p>When it comes to NatureKast, you really do have unlimited options with endless benefits—NatureKast offers a <a href="https://www.naturekast.com/stylesandfinishes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wide variety styles, finishes, and colors</a> for weatherproof outdoor kitchen cabinets that will resist the elements. </p>

For the building and construction industry, it could be interior design, architecture trends, or which city is the new hot spot for building—regardless of the trend’s current popularity, we know that will likely change in the coming years. </p>
<p>
However, there is one trend that will always be in style no matter what the day is: sustainable building. Lucky for you, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/trex-decking-benefits/">Trex decking</a> is the perfect solution for building green when it comes to your outdoor living project.</p>
<h3>What Makes Trex Decking Sustainable? </h3>
<p>Trex composite decking is made from <a href="https://www.trex.com/why-trex/eco-friendly-decking/" traget="_blank" rel="noopener">95% reclaimed wood and plastic film</a>—recycling at its finest. The following reasons are why Trex decking is the perfect choice for your sustainable building project:</p>
<ul>
•	<strong>Reclaimed wood</strong>. Trex sources local reclaimed wood for composite decking, minimizing landfill waste and tree use.<br />
•	<strong>Recycled plastic film</strong>. Trex combines reclaimed wood with recycled plastic film from paper towel overwrap, sandwich bags, newspaper sleeves, and grocery bags.</ul>
</ul>
<p>Composite decking the best choice when it comes to sustainable building. The average 500-square foot composite deck contains 140,000 recycled plastic bags, making Trex one of the largest plastic bag recyclers in the country. If you’re looking to minimize your carbon footprint and build green, using Trex decking for your outdoor living project is a no-brainer. </p>
<h3>How is Trex Decking Made? </h3>
<p>If you’re not already convinced that it’s important to find sustainable building products, let’s take a look at the production process of Trex decking:</p>
<ul>
<p>1.	Buy reclaimed wood/sawdust and recycled plastic film;<br />
2.	Clean and ground film into granules;<br />
3.	Combine and heat sawdust and film;<br />
4.	Mix mixture and form into boards;<br />
5.	Cool and cut boards;<br />
6.	Inspect boards for color accuracy, strength, and defects; and<br />
7.	Wrap and ship boards.</ul>
</ul>
<p>Not only is Trex decking an eco-friendly product, but the manufacturing process is just as green when it comes to eliminating environmental waste. Almost 100% of Trex’s factory runoff from production is recycled and reused for the next project!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0" class="mce_SELRES_start"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>﻿</span>New England carries a unique charm that no other part of the country can compete with—the historic yet up-and-coming feel of <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is what makes our great city special. These historical beauties are a crowd favorite for their timeless architecture and beauty.</p>
<p>
<?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s historic homes may be beautiful, but anyone who lives in a house that is a century old knows the challenges of renovating them. When it’s time to renovate, how do you honor the historical roots while modernizing the home itself? Here are a few tips to keep in mind during a historic home renovation in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>.</p>
<h3>1. Choose Historic Home Design Experts </h3>
<p>The first step to any renovation project is finding the right people for the job—choose <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/meet-the-team/">interior experts</a> who have expertise with historic home renovations. If you choose an interior designer who lacks experience in this area, it will show in your renovation.</p>
<h3>2. Keep Historic Elements </h3>
<p>The second step to modernizing a historic home is choosing which historic elements to keep and which ones to renovate. For example, a house that has 200-year-old millwork might be able to be restored and exposed. Take these elements and pair them with modern touches such as sleek countertops, accent furniture, and new appliances to create a timeless look and feel.</p>
<h3>3. Showcase Lighting </h3>
<p>If you keep it traditional with your décor, appliances, and furniture, you add a contemporary accent by showcasing your lighting. An elegant chandelier or modern floor lamp will add a touch of modern sophistication without taking away from the historical elements.</p>
<h3>4. Outdoor Renovation </h3>
<p>When renovating any home, always remember the deck. Historical homes are known for their spacious piazzas—you might even get lucky with two decks! Porches are a great opportunity to combine modern with historical by adding modern outdoor furniture or classic rocking chairs. Of course, always pay attention to how old your decking is. If the wood is rotting or splintering, it might be worth it to invest in <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/discover-trex/">composite decking</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Clean Lines </h3>
<p>After you choose which historical architectural elements you want to keep, it’s time to highlight them. For example, you can emphasize brickwork with clean lines, smooth surfaces, and neutral colors—this showcases the aesthetics and texture of the brick without overshadowing it. Try adding a modern twist to your home with shaker-style cabinets and granite countertops.</p>
<h3>Contact a Home Remodel Experts at <?php echo $row['name']; ?> Today </h3>
<p>When it comes to meshing modern with historical, the key is finding the right elements to complement each other and creating balance. At <?php echo $row['name']; ?> , we carry a variety of building materials for all your historic home renovation needs. </p>
<p>
Whether you’re looking for a modern twist or traditional beauty, we have the products you—molding, countertops, flooring, decking, cabinets, windows, doors—you name it, we can help. <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/contact-us/">Give us a call</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/x6wT35D1AFqYZEf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop by our showroom</a> today to consult with an experienced remodel expert and find out how we can help with your historic home remodel.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you thinking about building a deck? Adding or renovating your property’s deck is a great way to add value and beauty to your property— but like every building project, there are some things you need to know before you start. Depending on where you live, your budget, and your personal tastes, your decking material options might differ from others&#8217;. Each decking material comes with its own maintenance requirements, aesthetic appeal, cost, and other important factors to keep in mind when choosing what&#8217;s right for you and your home.</p>
<h2>Introducing Trex Composite Decking</h2>
<p>One of the most popular types of decking in 2021 is Trex. If you’re in the building materials industry world, you’ve probably heard the debate between Trex and wood. Trex decking is a great alternative to wood decking, especially since it looks exactly like wood.</p>
<p>Although it looks like wood, composite decking is a durable composite material that is made from plastic, wood fibers, and a bonding agent— all recycled materials, which is a popular trend in today’s environmentally conscious society. Trex is greener and more durable—what more could you want for your deck?</p>
<h2>Why Trex?</h2>
<p>When picking out any building material, there’s always four factors to consider: cost, maintenance, eco-friendliness, and of course, look and aesthetics. There are many advantages to using composite decking over wood decking.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>In general, Trex decking is typically a bigger investment than wood decking. As we mentioned earlier, Trex is a more durable material, which means it lasts longer than wood. With wood decking, you’ll be replacing warped and damaged woods—we know how the weather gets in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Although composite decking is a bigger investment, you’ll be saving money in the long run.</p>
<h3>Maintenance</h3>
<p>Not all decking materials are made the same, and not all of them have the same durability. The goal is to get a finished product that will last for years, but that’s not the reality for most decks. Wood decking requires more maintenance than Trex for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Weather</strong>. As we mentioned above, living in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> comes with a lot of weather and harsh elements—you’ll have to replace warped or damaged boards and frequently paint and reseal wood.</li>
<li><strong>Critters</strong>. Unwanted critters, especially termites, are a common problem with wood decking. There’s no proven way to stop them from feasting on your deck, which will add up to constant repairs.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Eco-Conscious</h3>
<p>Trex decking is made from 95% recycled materials, making it the ultimate choice for an environmentally-sound conscious. These materials include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grocery and bakery bags,</li>
<li>Newspaper and produce bags,</li>
<li>Toilet paper packaging and paper towel packaging,</li>
<li>Water bottle packaging,</li>
<li>Dry cleaning plastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>You name it, Trex recycles it into decking! It is possible to find reclaimed wood for your decking project, but most wood decking is made from timber harvested from forests. If you’re looking to lessen your carbon footprint, Trex is definitely the greener choice.</p>
<h3>Look &amp; Aesthetics</h3>
<p>Last but certainly not least, always consider the overall look and aesthetics of your deck—not only should your deck look nice, but it also should match the home it’s attached to. When using wood decking, you must look at color and grain, which are more limited in options than that of Trex decking.</p>
<p>When you choose Trex decking you, you immediately have a bigger variety of colors to choose from, making it much easier to match your vision for your newly renovated home. You also will avoid stains and fading, which a common problem with wood decking.</p>
<h2>Interested in Using Trex Decking? Contact a Decking Expert at <?php echo $row['name']; ?> Today</h2>
<p>Now that we’ve gone over the benefits of Trex decking, it’s time for you to choose what will work best for your project. Although composite decking is a bigger investment, it’s just that—an investment. Trex is an investment for a more durable, greener, better-looking decking option which will ultimately be more cost-effective.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are a condo owner in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, you may be thinking about renovations to make to your home. Fall is a great time to get some additions or remodeling done on your condo. As the days start getting shorter, you’ll want to make your condo as cozy and functional as possible in preparation for long winter nights. Here are a few <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/top-boston-renovation-projects-for-fall/">fall projects </a>you should consider for your <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo this fall.<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Change the Wall Colors</b></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve been living in your condo for a while, you might be tired of seeing the same walls every day. Try repainting your walls with a different color of paint or replacing the wallpaper with something fresh. To make your rooms feel cheerful and welcoming, go for colors that are bright but not too bold. You don’t even need a professional—repainting is simple enough to do on your own. Although it’s time consuming, it can serve as a fun project for the weekends.<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weatherstrip Your Doors</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, people have been investing in climate-proofing their homes to protect against extreme weather patterns. Weatherstripping your doors is especially important to keep your condo warm during those cold <?php echo $row['country']; ?> winters, and it also leads to savings on your energy bill.</p>
<p>There are a variety of options when it comes to weatherstripping materials, each with different advantages and drawbacks. For example, rubber is the most durable, but it is also expensive and challenging to install. Weatherstripping is a simple process. Simply cut the weatherstrip into three pieces—two for the sides and one for the top—and stick them into place. Finish the project by adding a door sweep for the bottom of the door. Like repainting, this is another project you can do yourself.<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Upgrade Your Bathroom Tiles</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In a condo, you may not be able to move around bathroom fixtures without draining your wallet. Luckily, there are less expensive ways you can elevate your bathroom to the next level. You can update the tile and flooring for a fresh look. Small, textured tiles for your shower floor are a must-have. Not only do they look elegant, but the extra grouting and the texture help prevent slips caused by wet and soapy floors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Add Recessed Cabinets for Effective Use of Space</b></li>
</ul>
<p><?php echo $row['country']; ?> condos can be small, so it is important to get the most out of your space. You can add a recessed medicine cabinet to your bathroom to take up less space while giving you a good amount of storage. These can be labor-intensive to install, but they offer an elegant look to your bathroom and go well with any bathroom design, whether it’s traditional or modern.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Maximize Your Kitchen Storage</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The kitchen has one of the biggest storage requirements of all the rooms in your condo. Even if your kitchen is small, there are ways to make the most of wasted space. If your condo has a banquette, install drawers or shelves below the seating to maximize your use of floor space. For your kitchen cabinets, use soft-closing full extension drawers or increase cabinet sizes to reduce unused wall space.</p>
<p>You can also add toe-kick drawers. The toe-kick is the space between the bottom of your lower cabinets and the floor, and it is there for ergonomic reasons. By adding toe-kick drawers, you create more space while maintaining the ergonomics of your kitchen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Add Technology to Your Bathroom</b></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also turn your bathroom into a<a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/take-your-boston-bathroom-to-new-heights/"> technological hub</a>. No more straining to hear your phone over the water—add a water-resistant speaker to listen to music while you shower. Installing a waterproof TV into your bathroom wall can help you unwind after a long day with a hot bath and good show. Finally, you can install LED lights in your shower or tub. These cycle through different colors, creating a fun and calming atmosphere.<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>&nbsp;Install Energy Efficient Windows</b></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-window-replacement-questions-to-ask-for-your-historic-renovation/">Window replacements</a>, both wood and vinyl, made the list among the top ten best upscale improvements that you can make. Once you’ve seen all of the new advancements in energy efficient window technology, such as better window coatings and glazes, lower air leakage rates, and more, you won’t be surprised by this improvement’s high ranking.</p>
<h3><b>8. Upgrade the Lighting</b></h3>
<p>The days are getting shorter, which means that you’ll get a lot of mileage out of new lighting. Today, buyers and owners alike are looking for bright, even lighting — although you can always install dimmer switches in key areas like the living room or bedrooms. Recessed lighting will make up the bulk of your new design, but don’t hesitate to add in a chandelier here or there as a statement piece.</p>
<p>This remodel is one that will certainly require a permit to complete. Of course, if any of the other <?php echo $row['country']; ?> condo renovation ideas that we have mentioned end up as extensive renovations, then you may need a permit for those as well, but for the windows, it is a certainty. You may want to check out our <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/want-to-step-up-your-home-improvement-contractor-relationship-read-this-first/">post about contractor relationships</a>, where we discuss the types of relationships you can have, and the contractor’s responsibility, which includes obtaining the necessary permits.</p>
<p>Get started with any of these ideas to improve the look and function of your condo. If you are planning to sell your property in the future, these renovations can also make your condo more attractive to potential buyers. With these upgrades, you’ll look forward to spending comfortable fall and winter days in your home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that summer is in full swing, you’ll be spending a lot more time on your deck. Spend the summer in style by making sure your deck is up to date with the latest trends. If you’re looking to </span><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/6-deck-design-trends-to-try-this-summer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">revamp your deck</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, here are some tips to help you make your deck the best it can be.</span></p>
<p><b>Go for an Industrial Look</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A modern, industrial style is quickly gaining popularity over traditional rustic designs. Cable or glass railings can provide an unobstructed view of the landscape beyond your deck, with the added bonus of not requiring much maintenance. For flooring, use composite deck boards with sleek and sophisticated lines to create a simple yet elegant look. These lines don’t have to move in the same direction—get creative by laying out some boards diagonally or perpendicular to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stamped concrete is another versatile great way to get an industrial look. It can be used for the deck floor or support pillars, and it comes in many colors. Neutral tones such as earthy browns, muted grays, and cooler blues are the current trending colors, but you should choose whatever colors work best for you.</span></p>
<p><b>Set up a Covered Area</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transform your deck into an extension of your living room with this trend that blends practicality with style. A covered area provides ample shade, so you can spend time outside even in the heat of a summer afternoon. You can add a latticework enclosure for greater privacy while still being able to enjoy the view. If you’re going for a more natural look, fast-growing vines can also provide privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Covered areas come in different sizes and shapes. The arbor is the smallest option. It has two to four posts and an open slatted roof. A pergola traditionally has four posts and an open roof that can be covered by fabric, offering flexibility with how covered the deck is. A gazebo offers the most room and privacy and comes in a variety of shapes, typically hexagonal or octagonal. Finally, the attached overhead is a roof that connects to the back wall of your house and is supported on the deck by strong pillars. The type of covered area you choose depends on your preferences and what fits best with your deck.</span></p>
<p><b>Include an Outdoor Television</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This trend started last year and is still going strong. With an outdoor TV, you can experience the best of both worlds—relaxing with a good show and enjoying the great outdoors at the same time. An outdoor TV allows you to transform your deck into a second family room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you followed the previous tip and added a covered area, you can feel comfortable placing your TV outside without concern about rain damage. For extra protection, you can invest in a waterproof TV that can survive wind, rain, and even snow. Either way, you don’t want to miss out on the chance to host outdoor gaming or movie nights with your friends and family.</span></p>
<p><b>Make Use of Underdeck Spaces</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a raised deck, this trend is perfect for you. Underdeck spaces have been undervalued for years, with people using them mainly for storage. Now, people are realizing the untapped potential of this space. It’s essentially a built-in covered area with plenty of room for furniture. Add outdoor couches for comfort or a table for having snacks, and you’ll turn your underdeck space into one of the most relaxing parts of the house.</span></p>
<p><b>Play with Lighting</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lighting is essential to enjoying your deck at night. In addition to helping you see in the darkness, the type of lighting you choose can set the atmosphere of your deck and create ambience. You can have illuminated risers if your deck is made of multiple levels. If your deck has a small fountain or pond, you can put small lights in the water to create a magical glowing effect. You can even hang up a simple string of lights for an exceptionally cozy look. There are countless opportunities here, and it really depends on the mood you’re going for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are a few of this summer’s biggest deck design trends. By following these tips, you can transform your deck into the perfect backyard retreat.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you’re living in a city like <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, outdoor space comes at a premium. All those rowhouses don’t offer much in the way of backyard spaces—and yet, there’s still a need to get outside and enjoy fresh air along with a beautiful view. So how does one get that outdoor space when you’ve not got a big backyard? The key is to build up! Create your own roof deck where you can spend evenings enjoying the skyline view and sparkling lights.</span></p>
<p><b>Getting Started: Codes and Regulations</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing you’ll need to do is ensure that your roof deck plans follow <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s building codes. Restrictions may vary by the specific municipality, so check in the area in which you live for things like permitting requirements and inspection requirements. You’ll also need to learn about building specifics. For instance, in an area classified as a “</span><a href="http://www.<?php echo $row['country']; ?>plans.org/getattachment/2a60e7c4-517f-4731-8406-7dac510227e2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restricted roof structure district</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” you’ll need to follow certain rules to make sure that your new structure doesn’t alter the building’s profile—or you’ll need to obtain permission to make a change that would alter the building’s profile.</span></p>
<p><b>Roof Deck Trends</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve got building codes and permits out of the way, the next step is to design the deck of your dreams. Think about what you want from the space, because there are many directions in which you can go.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Rooftop Gardening: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing your own fruits and vegetables is huge right now—and it’s a great way to beautify your new outdoor space with a bit of greenery, too. If you’re considering a rooftop garden, then you’ll want to think about the fixtures you’ll need to make gardening easier. As an example, make sure you include a spigot somewhere within your plans to make watering plants easier.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Outdoor Entertaining: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">For this, you’ll need plenty of open space so you can arrange tables and seating. You can also consider installing things like an outdoor kitchen or wet bar.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Lounge Space:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is among the more common ways to put a roof deck to work, as a private hideaway where you can get outside, curl up in a comfy chair, and relax. If you go this route, you’ll want to put some thought into design choices—design styles, colors, greenery, furniture and whatever else you’ll need to create an inviting, restful space.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whatever direction you decide for your deck, design with one thought in mind: To make the most of this space so that you’ll continue to enjoy it for years to come.</span></p>
<p><b>What You’ll Need to Put it All Together</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you’ve made some design decisions, you’ll likely need to call on the services of a few professionals to bring your dream deck to life. Start the process with an architect or structural engineer. They can help you get started on the plans that you’ll later give to your contractor. More importantly, they can help you with things like permits and building codes by ensuring that those plans are up to your municipality’s regulations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Next up, you’ll need a contractor. Since roof decks are such a popular way to create outdoor spaces in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, you’ll find no shortage of professionals who specialize in this exact type of construction project. At</span><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/build-the-boston-roof-deck-of-your-dreams/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;"><?php echo $row['name']; ?> </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we can help you out with a few recommendations if you’re not sure where to look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you have a list of contractors, start by checking out their portfolios. Choose from among professionals who feature the types of projects and the styles that you’re going for. Get bids from several contractors so that you can choose based not only on the pricing and options that they offer, but also so that you can get a feel for how well you’ll work together during the construction process.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there you have it! Roof decks are a fabulous way to give yourself some much-needed outdoor space, and they can also double as garden space or a place to entertain your guests. That’s what makes them so popular in places like <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. When you’re ready to get started, use some of the thoughts above to help guide you through the process!</span></p>
