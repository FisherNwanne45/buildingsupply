										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0" class="mce_SELRES_start"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>﻿</span>New England carries a unique charm that no other part of the country can compete with—the historic yet up-and-coming feel of <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is what makes our great city special. These historical beauties are a crowd favorite for their timeless architecture and beauty.</p>
<p>
<?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s historic homes may be beautiful, but anyone who lives in a house that is a century old knows the challenges of renovating them. When it’s time to renovate, how do you honor the historical roots while modernizing the home itself? Here are a few tips to keep in mind during a historic home renovation in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>.</p>
<h3>1. Choose Historic Home Design Experts </h3>
<p>The first step to any renovation project is finding the right people for the job—choose <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/meet-the-team/">interior experts</a> who have expertise with historic home renovations. If you choose an interior designer who lacks experience in this area, it will show in your renovation.</p>
<h3>2. Keep Historic Elements </h3>
<p>The second step to modernizing a historic home is choosing which historic elements to keep and which ones to renovate. For example, a house that has 200-year-old millwork might be able to be restored and exposed. Take these elements and pair them with modern touches such as sleek countertops, accent furniture, and new appliances to create a timeless look and feel.</p>
<h3>3. Showcase Lighting </h3>
<p>If you keep it traditional with your décor, appliances, and furniture, you add a contemporary accent by showcasing your lighting. An elegant chandelier or modern floor lamp will add a touch of modern sophistication without taking away from the historical elements.</p>
<h3>4. Outdoor Renovation </h3>
<p>When renovating any home, always remember the deck. Historical homes are known for their spacious piazzas—you might even get lucky with two decks! Porches are a great opportunity to combine modern with historical by adding modern outdoor furniture or classic rocking chairs. Of course, always pay attention to how old your decking is. If the wood is rotting or splintering, it might be worth it to invest in <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/discover-trex/">composite decking</a>.</p>
<h3>5. Clean Lines </h3>
<p>After you choose which historical architectural elements you want to keep, it’s time to highlight them. For example, you can emphasize brickwork with clean lines, smooth surfaces, and neutral colors—this showcases the aesthetics and texture of the brick without overshadowing it. Try adding a modern twist to your home with shaker-style cabinets and granite countertops.</p>
<h3>Contact a Home Remodel Experts at <?php echo $row['name']; ?> Today </h3>
<p>When it comes to meshing modern with historical, the key is finding the right elements to complement each other and creating balance. At <?php echo $row['name']; ?> , we carry a variety of building materials for all your historic home renovation needs. </p>
<p>
Whether you’re looking for a modern twist or traditional beauty, we have the products you—molding, countertops, flooring, decking, cabinets, windows, doors—you name it, we can help. <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/contact-us/">Give us a call</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/x6wT35D1AFqYZEf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop by our showroom</a> today to consult with an experienced remodel expert and find out how we can help with your historic home remodel.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the COVID-19 crisis, there’s lots of buzz flying around about how this affects the construction industry in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Right now, there is an indefinite moratorium on construction within the city. But what exactly does that mean? Let’s take a look at who is impacted by this and who is able to respond during this challenging time. Of course, a comeback will be coming, too, so we’ll examine what that comeback could look like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impact</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the COVID-19 pandemic picked up steam, officials in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> and the state of Massachusetts took measures to limit the spread of the virus. On March 17, Mayor Walsh put a two-week ban on all projects that the city of <?php echo $row['country']; ?> had permitted, this in an effort to slow the virus’s spread. By March 25, the Mayor announced that this ban would be indefinite—even though Governor Charlie Baker has said that construction should continue throughout Massachusetts in view of the state’s housing crisis. In a letter from the governor’s office, Walsh stated that to prevent economic disruption, projects should continue as long as social distancing protocols are observed. In <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, however, Mayor Walsh’s moratorium still stands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some projects are still continuing, however. In <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, the work stoppage is specifically limited to projects that the city itself has approved. And that is quite a few projects, including everything from apartments and condos to commercials spaces like laboratories and hotels. State-approved construction projects, however, are still ongoing although work is at the discretion of developers and contractors, which means that some project managers have called a halt on their projects in an effort to keep their workers safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s building moratorium does have a few caveats to be aware of. Some specific projects are still allowed to continue. These include projects like hospitals and other buildings to promote public health and safety, work that makes residential buildings fully habitable is still allowed, and residential construction for buildings that include three units or less are still ongoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, the moratorium’s impact is far-reaching given the number of city projects that have come to a halt. But there are still some opportunities out there what with state-approved projects still underway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Response</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And how are people responding? Many suppliers—including NEBS—are still open for business in order to supply the essential goods that operating construction projects need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On state and even nationwide levels, we’re seeing varied responses—just as the city of <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s moratorium conflicts with the Governor’s request to keep construction going. In some places in the United States, construction is considered essential, particularly in places experiencing serious housing shortages. Other places have done just as <?php echo $row['country']; ?> has done by ordering work stoppages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, many construction industry groups are lobbying for construction to be considered an essential industry. At the smaller scale, employers and contracting businesses are torn—and this is something we’re seeing in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Workers need a steady paycheck plus access to health insurance, and contractors often have contractual obligations to finish a project by a certain date, which now may not be possible given work stoppages. At the same time, these people are concerned about health and safety, too. That’s why we’ve seen two unions so far—the North Atlantic Regional Council of Carpenters and the Painters and Allied Trades Union—call for their workers to walk off construction sites. The fear is that these workers don’t have enough personal protective equipment to reduce exposure, and that they are unable to properly practice social distancing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a Comeback</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that a comeback will happen. After all, construction is one of those industries that just can’t stop. We will always have a demand for new homes, commercial spaces and more. So it’s not a question of whether or not that comeback will take place, but what shape it will take. In the construction industry, we’re liable to see a slow return to work as new cases of the virus lessen while state and city officials gradually lift restrictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply chain issues may be a problem for a while as suppliers scramble to make up for lost time. The big supply challenge to watch out for will be materials buying sprees that may occur as the industry picks up steam again. Such mass buyouts of supplies could result in shortages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While consumer confidence may be shaky, it’s likely that lenders—who were doing quite well before this crisis—will be eager to resume their business. That means during the recovery process, it may be easier for people within the construction industry to secure financing for new projects as people across sectors work hard to get the economy moving again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no doubt that challenging times are before us. But the construction industry within <?php echo $row['country']; ?> and elsewhere, too, will make a comeback. It’s only a matter of time before this crisis passes and we can all get back to work!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In terms of siding, fiber cement is a relative newcomer to the market. Wood, brick and even things like vinyl siding have all been around for quite a while, but fiber cement siding was introduced about 35 years ago. Since then, it’s been steadily growing in popularity for a variety of reasons. Companies like<a href="https://www.jameshardie.com/"> James Hardie</a> produce this type of siding, which offers a wonderful alternative to wood, vinyl and similar siding materials. If you want to learn more about why fiber cement is quickly becoming the siding material of choice, read on and we’ll show you!</p>
<h3><strong>1. Fiber Cement Replicates the Look of Wood Without the Hassle</strong></h3>
<p>Wood siding can be problematic in humid climates, prone to moss, mildew and rot. Plus there is insect damage to contend with, too. Cracking, warping and splintering are common problems with wood, and it needs to be repainted and maintained more than most other types of siding, including fiber cement.</p>
<p>Fiber cement, on the other hand, stands up to moisture very well, and it won’t rot, crack or splinter. It’s a thick, durable material that allows manufacturers to make deep grooves in its surface. This means that above all other wood lookalikes, fiber cement is the siding alternative that offers the most realistic look. In fact, some historic districts approve fiber cement siding because it looks just like the real thing.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Fiber Cement is Non-Combustible</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you need to meet area fire codes or you are building in an area where wildfires are a concern, this type of siding is a great option because it won’t ignite when exposed to direct flame. It’s also a great alternative if melted vinyl siding is a potential problem. Sometimes vinyl can melt or warp in high temperatures, which can occur when windows, especially low-E windows, reflect onto the siding.</p>
<h3><strong>3. It’s a Versatile Siding Material</strong></h3>
<p>Fiber cement panels that replicate the look of wood are a popular choice, but there are even more options available. Not just panels, but also siding that replicates lapped siding as well as shingles and blocks. There are lots of finishes available, too—painted, stained or primed so you can add your own color, or raw so that you can tailor finish it according to the project’s needs.</p>
<h3><strong>4. It’s the Easiest Way to Achieve that Coveted Modern Look</strong></h3>
<p>Sleek modern styles are all the rage in exteriors these days, often featuring color-blocked siding to make a bold statement. It’s difficult to achieve this look with other types of siding, but fiber cement panels make it easy to create that blocky, colorful look.</p>
<h3><strong>5. Affordability</strong></h3>
<p>One of the best things about fiber cement is that compared to wood or aluminum siding, it’s very affordably priced. It does cost more than vinyl, which is generally the cheapest option, but it comes with a much longer lifespan plus low maintenance costs, which offset the initial installation cost. Where things like painting are concerned, if you choose factory finished fiber cement, the paint can last up to twenty years. Even when it does need to be repainted, or if the homeowner simply desires to change colors, that paint will last longer than on wood because fiber cement doesn’t warp, expand, shrink, blister or crack.</p>
<h3><strong>6. Fiber Cement is Eco-Friendly</strong></h3>
<p>One drawback to fiber cement is that right now, there aren’t recycling programs that handle it. However, because this building material lasts decades, it causes less waste than other types of siding that need to be replacement. What’s more, it’s an inert building material, free of toxins and problematic chemicals, which means that in landfills, it doesn’t leech harmful chemicals into the environment.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in trying out fiber cement siding, our <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/design-center/">downtown <?php echo $row['country']; ?> design center</a> stocks James Hardie products. Check out the video below to learn a little bit about Hardie’s Statement Collection. And don’t forget that you can always stop by our design center to check out these products and pick up samples that you can present to local officials for fire and building code approval.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of questions swirling around about the future economy, particularly in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. What will be coming in 2020? If you’re a developer or involved in construction, here are a few things you’ll need to know and how predictions could affect our <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/beantown-has-become-boom-town-for-developers/">booming beantown</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Business Owners have a Bleak Outlook</strong></h3>
<p>Recent surveys in Massachusetts show that business owners are hunkering down for the coming year. In October 2019, <a href="https://blog.aimnet.org/aim-issueconnect/massachusetts-companies-wary-of-economic-downturn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://blog.aimnet.org/aim-issueconnect/massachusetts-companies-wary-of-economic-downturn">Associated Industries of Massachusetts</a> reported that a full two-thirds of survey respondents not only expected an economic slowdown for 2020, but a contraction. Already, Massachusetts is seeing the effects of this, with employers hesitant to hire, fewer purchases being made, and extra inventory liquidated.</p>
<h3><strong>But the Construction Market Shows Otherwise</strong></h3>
<p>Business owners bracing for impact—that’s one side of the picture. On the other end of things, in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, it looks as through the construction sector will continue to grow in 2020. Data from <a href="https://ccorpinsights.com/regional/<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://ccorpinsights.com/regional/<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/">Cumming Insights</a> shows where construction is expected to remain steady, and where it will keep growing.</p>
<p>According to their predictions, the housing market will stay steady, showing no growth for the year. However, the tech industry within <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is booming. With the rising demand for tech, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/2019-boston-real-estate-development-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction growth</a> will shift to this sector. In fact, tech growth is expected to be a major driving force behind <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s economy during 2020. This is because there are lots of things supporting this growth—proximity to Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for instance, plus plenty of start-ups providing jobs for new residents flocking to the city. There are also several major tech corporations expanding within Massachusetts, including Verizon, Apple and Google.</p>
<p>Things like hospitality and gaming are growing, with new hotels and casinos opening. With the population rising and unemployment low throughout the city, it’s expected that sectors including healthcare, education and manufacturing could grow to meet the city’s demands.</p>
<h3><strong><?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s Industry is Recession-Proof, But the Housing Market?</strong></h3>
<p>Economists believe that by 2022, the United States will have entered another recession. <?php echo $row['country']; ?> itself is expected to stay strong throughout largely because of major industries that just keep growing. Often during a recession, the housing market enters a downturn along with the rest of the economy, with home prices falling. But experts believe that <?php echo $row['country']; ?> may be different in this regard. Because of the industry keeping new residents flocking to the city, and because of the scarcity in available homes within <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, prices are expected to remain high.</p>
<p>And what about new residential construction? Contractors will continue to build new homes and condos, of course, but there may not be much growth, if any, in this part of the construction sector. That’s in large part because homebuyers will feel the hit to their wallets. Inflation will go up, raising the cost of living, while housing prices remain high, which reduces the average individual’s buying power.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Construction Trends to Look for in <?php echo $row['country']; ?></strong></h3>
<p>It’s a safe bet that construction will grow across health, education and tech industries. But what about other construction markets?</p>
<p>Public transit may be a big industry to look at in 2020. This is because with housing prices remaining high, residents are flocking away from the more expensive districts nearer to their workplaces. The result is longer commutes, congested traffic, and a strain on public transit systems. Construction may grow in this area simply to help alleviate these issues.</p>
<p>Zoning changes, if approved by local lawmakers, could also drastically shift the construction picture in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>. Right now, lots of <?php echo $row['country']; ?> areas are zoned against multi-family development projects. However, lawmakers are already starting to shift. For example, in Somerville and Cambridge, there are proposals being considered that would allow for affordable housing in the areas.</p>
<p>Flexible co-working spaces may be another trend for developers to look out for. The growing number of startups means that these new businesses need flexible spaces to expand. Currently, there are more than 3.7 million square feet of co-working spaces within <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, and that’s a number that could grow as this trend continues.</p>
<p>Overall, while some reports paint a bleak picture of business contraction and a looming recession, <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is a resilient city with strong industries that will continue to hold steady no matter what the economy does. What does this mean for developers and contractors? It means that there will always be work—but the focus may shift away from things like housing or retail and more toward tech and office space.</p>
<p>Our building materials business is <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/located-in-the-heart-of-the-boston-building-boom/">located in the heart of <?php echo $row['country']; ?></a> and continues to assist developers and contractors in building <?php echo $row['country']; ?> whether the project is residential, commercial or mixed use.&nbsp;</p>

When done correctly, <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/subtle-crown-moulding-and-trim-ideas-for-boston-home/">crown molding</a>, door and window trim, chair rail and&nbsp;baseboards all work together&nbsp;to form a cohesive look that&nbsp;becomes part of the architecture of the room. Though interior trim serves the practical purpose of&nbsp;bridging small gaps&nbsp;between the&nbsp;walls, ceiling, floors&nbsp;and&nbsp;openings, it&#8217;s also&nbsp;an important way to&nbsp;lay the baseline for whatever decorating style you prefer in your home. Trim should be carefully chosen to work with the proportions of your home as well as its time period so it looks like it&#8217;s been in place forever.</p>
<h2>Types of Interior Trim</h2>
<p>Before you can shop for the right <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/update-your-trim-design-increases-overall-home-value/">trim</a> for your home, it&#8217;s important to know what types are available. Here&#8217;s your basic glossary:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crown Molding:&nbsp;</strong>An&nbsp;angled piece of trim that covers the corner between the wall and the ceiling. Crown molding&nbsp;requires mitered cuts in the corners and comes in many&nbsp;profiles. Generally speaking, wider pieces of crown molding are more formal, while smaller pieces with fewer ridges and curves are more casual and modern.</li>
<li><strong>Door Casing:&nbsp;</strong>This trim creates a frame around a doorway and hides the framing pieces and shims that were used to install the door. This trim can be mitered at the corners or used with square blocks and straight-cut pieces.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Window Casing:</strong>&nbsp;Like door casing, window casing frames windows and hides any&nbsp;gaps around them. In the past, window trim also hid the inner workings of the sash&nbsp;weights, but today&#8217;s trim is mostly used for decoration. Window and door casing often coordinate, though the proportions may vary depending on the size of the windows.</li>
<li><strong>Baseboard:</strong>&nbsp;This trim piece bridges the gap between the wall and the floor. In very modern spaces, it could be as simple as a piece of quarter round; for homes with high ceilings, baseboards are often several inches high.</li>
<li><strong>Chair Rail:&nbsp;</strong>This piece of trim is hung horizontally on the wall&nbsp;at the height of a chair back. Originally used to protect plaster from gouges and dings as chairs were pushed back against the wall, today it&#8217;s a decorative touch most often used in formal dining rooms or as a transition piece around wainscoting.</li>
<li><strong>Wainscoting:&nbsp;</strong>This decorative paneling is used on the lower half of walls and is often painted or stained to contrast with the wall above. Wainscoting was originally used as a way to waterproof the lower half of plaster walls, but today it is purely decorative. <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/beaded-inset-and-plain-inset-kitchen-cabinets/">Beadboard&nbsp;</a>is one popular type of wainscoting that has vertical ridges, or beads.</li>
<li><strong>Panel Molding:</strong>&nbsp;Panel molding are ridged&nbsp;trim pieces that&nbsp;can be used to create frames. These frames are then placed on the wall to simulate&nbsp;raised panels — often as wainscoting or around a fireplace or other focal point.&nbsp;Panel molding can be used to create an endless array of patterns on the wall or even the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Shiplap&nbsp;Paneling:</strong>&nbsp;Wide, flat boards that lock together are placed horizontally&nbsp;to form shiplap&nbsp;paneling. This style of paneling is very popular and is often used to create a rustic accent wall. In the South, shiplap&nbsp;was often used instead of plaster to create interior walls.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interior Decorating Styles</h2>
<p>Each type of trim comes in a range of styles, from the most basic, low-profile door casings to the most ornate crown molding. Knowing what style decor your gravitate toward will help you choose interior trim that blends well with that style. Here are some of the most popular decorating styles and tips for choosing the right trim for each one:</p>
<h3>Bohemian</h3>
<p>Bohemian style is eclectic and comfortable. It often features unique artwork or collections of vintage items to create an anything-goes vibe. There&#8217;s a hint of the exotic or old European here as well, so traditional trim styles work best: mitered door casings, curvaceous crown molding, and tall baseboard. You can also&nbsp;get creative&nbsp;with panel molding to add&nbsp;a unique design to&nbsp;walls for a truly artistic turn.</p>
<h3>Country</h3>
<p>Country style is relaxed and homey, with nods to&nbsp;history in&nbsp;the furniture choice (think&nbsp;Windsor chairs and&nbsp;tables with turned legs). While high ceilings may require&nbsp;large crown molding and baseboard, the lines can be simple, with few&nbsp;ridges and&nbsp;curves. Beadboard&nbsp;paneling creates a classic country look, whether used as wainscoting or to cover an entire wall. Wide windowsills create a cozy spot for plants, decorative items, or even a window seat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Modern Farmhouse</h3>
<p>Modern farmhouse style is an update of classic country that features a pared down look with cleaner&nbsp;lines. Furniture is usually modern and comfortable, but there are plenty of rustic touches like a farmhouse sink and shiplap paneling. Unpretentious trim can be flat (or nearly so) to keep in sync with the clean aesthetic. Trim will almost always be painted white to blend with white or gray walls in this style.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2496 size-medium" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/metrie-modern-farmhouse-300x200.jpg" alt="metrie modern farmhouse" width="300" height="200"></p>
<h3>New Traditional</h3>
<p>High ceilings, wide moldings, and paneled walls are hallmarks of traditional style. Based on the formal dining and parlor spaces of the&nbsp;1800s, traditional style is a classic decor that has stood the test of time. New traditional is somewhat less formal than pure Victorian decor, but you&#8217;ll still see chair rail with wainscoting and paneled doors that hearken back to the quality craftsmanship of a bygone era. New traditional style&nbsp;makes heavy use of panel molding to get the look of a fully paneled library or den&nbsp;without the expense.</p>
<h3>Shabby Chic</h3>
<p>Shabby chic combines old and new for a home that looks decorated but still well-loved and lived in. This style features antiques and distressed furniture pieces while retaining a feminine feel with a pastel palette. Given the antique feel of shabby chic, traditional molding styles with plenty of curves and decorative touches work well. Thinner, more delicate trim pieces will work better than very chunky ones, too.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Vintage Industrial</h3>
<p>Industrial style highlights the building materials and systems used in construction: exposed beams and brick, visible heating ducts, and plenty of industrial&nbsp;fixtures are all on display. This tends to be a more masculine style, and furniture is made of distressed or reclaimed wood and functional metal. Flat casings and panel moldings work well with this look; if crown molding and baseboards are used at all, they should&nbsp;have a clean profile but be substantially sized.&nbsp; &nbsp;<img decoding="async" class="alignright wp-image-2497 size-medium" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Metrie-Vintage-Industrial-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></p>
<h2>Coordinating Trim Pieces</h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve decided on your style, it can still be challenging to find molding and trim pieces that work well together. Metrie&nbsp;solves this problem with their&nbsp;<a href="https://metrie.com/optionM/builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://metrie.com/optionM/builder/">innovative Option {M}&nbsp;line of trim&nbsp;products</a>. They&#8217;ve taken all the guesswork out of mixing and matching trim&nbsp;with their collection of trim pieces&nbsp;that are&nbsp;grouped by decorating style.

They even have recommendations for choosing molding based on ceiling height and the proportions of your room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spring is on the way and that means <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-factors-to-guide-your-decision/">decking</a> is on everyone’s mind! Of course, you want your deck to look great and perform well for the coming barbecue season. But which decking material will you choose? For the most part, treated lumber almost always makes up the deck’s structure—although some brands,&nbsp;<a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/discover-trex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/discover-trex/">like Trex</a>, do make composite framing specifically for decks. When it comes to decking boards, the <a href="https://www.angieslist.com/articles/which-best-decking-material-wood-or-composite.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">primary choice</a>s are between treated wood and composite decking boards. Here are the pros and cons of both to help you decide! <span id="more-2470"></span></p>
<h3><strong>Composite Pros</strong></h3>
<p>Composite decking needs a lot less maintenance than wood, which means that even though the initial cost to purchase and install is higher, the deck will end up costing less over its lifetime since you won’t need to spend money on staining, sealing, refinishing and so on. Another great benefit to composite compared to wood is that products like Trex decking boards are much more durable than treated lumber. Trex products, in particular, are stain, scratch, fade and mold resistant. These boards won’t warp or crack like wood can, and you won’t have to worry about things like splinters cropping up after years of use. Homeowners often have concerns about sustainability and eco-friendliness, and that is one reason why they often turn to composite decking. These products are often made with recycled materials. For example, the<a href="https://www.trex.com/products/decking/enhance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Trex Enhance</a> and Transcend lines of decking materials are made with 95% recycled products.</p>
<h3><strong>Treated Wood Pros</strong></h3>
<p>Most decks today are made with wood, including the <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/3-factors-to-guide-your-decision/">decking boards</a> that make up the surface. The reason behind this is that initially, wood decking boards cost less to purchase and install. So, if you’re looking for a less expensive way to put a surface on your deck, treated lumber might be the way to go. Just keep in mind that over the life of a wood deck, you’ll end up spending more on maintenance. The look and feel of real wood is another reason why many go with treated lumber over composite decking. While some composites beautifully replicate the look of natural wood grain, color choices are often limited. With wood, you can choose from dozens of stains to get a deck color in the exact shade you desire.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Make the Choice</strong></h3>
<p>While you’re trying to decide which decking material is right for you, it helps to think about several factors.</p>
<ul>
<li>How will you use the deck? For decks that don’t see a lot of traffic, wood could be the right choice, but if you do a lot of entertaining or if various activities expose the deck to a lot of moisture (poolside, for instance), then composite might be the better alternative.</li>
<li>If you plan to sell your home soon, then ongoing maintenance is less of a concern, which means that you can safely choose treated lumber.</li>
<li>If you don’t plan to sell your home, how will you tackle maintenance? Hiring a contractor to maintain the deck makes wood decking more manageable but will end up costing you more in the long term.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, the choice all comes down to your needs for the deck. Maintenance throughout the deck’s life is something you’ll need to consider, and you’ll also need to think about your budget, both now and in the future. Wood decking will save you money in the short term, but composites like Trex can save on staining, sealing and maintenance throughout the years. &nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/2018-boston-building-boom-prediction/">2018</a> turned out to be a wild ride. After years of steady growth and rosy&nbsp;outlooks for developers in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, a variety of wrenches were thrown into the works last fall. Will this signal a long-term grinding of the gears for builders, or were the issues of last year anomalies that are already in the rearview mirror? While real estate can be a notoriously difficult industry to predict, it&#8217;s possible to make some educated guesses about the state of the business for developers. We&#8217;ll break down the biggest trends in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> real estate and explore the issues most likely to impact 2019&#8217;s outlook for property developers.</p>
<h2>The Lockout Is Over</h2>
<p>In case you&#8217;ve been under a rock for the past seven months:&nbsp;National Grid&#8217;s contract with its unionized gas workers expired back in June, and when they couldn&#8217;t reach an agreement on new terms, the gas&nbsp;company locked out its workers and turned to replacement linemen with less experience. While this action kept things going for awhile, the real blow came in October, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eagletribune.com/gas_fires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Columbia Gas lines exploded all over Lawrence and the Andovers</a>&nbsp;due to an over-pressurization issue. This meant that any and all gas line workers were redirected to put out (very literal) fires and get the three cities up and running so residents could return home before winter&#8217;s chill set in. Meanwhile, towns across Eastern Massachusetts&nbsp;<a href="http://billerica.wickedlocal.com/news/20181231/national-grid-lockout-comes-to-end" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put the kibosh on new gas work</a>&nbsp;until National Grid could guarantee experienced workers would be doing the work to keep everyone safe from another round of explosions and fires.</p>
<p>For builders, this was one-two punch to their schedules. Projects were put on hold or delayed due to a lack of labor available to complete orders. Most&nbsp;towns called an end to gas line work in December anyway due to freezing weather, but the big question was when work could resume on a normal schedule. Fortunately,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/vote-could-end-months-long-national-grid-lockout/25773351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there&#8217;s finally a deal in place</a>, and union workers should be back on the job and working through the backlog ASAP.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Upshot:</strong>&nbsp;By spring, gas woes should be a thing of the past, and your building schedule will likely&nbsp;proceed as expected.</p>
<h2>The Economy Is Iffy</h2>
<p>Anyone with an IRA has been watching nervously as the stock market roller&nbsp;coasters its way into the New Year. The economy has been on the upswing for years now, and builders have benefited from a whole lot of investment in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> — just count the cranes as you drive into the city on the Expressway for a daily reminder of just&nbsp;how quickly the skyline is evolving. Many economists think that an economic slowdown is inevitable after flying high for so long, and those concerns trickle into real estate in predictable ways.&nbsp;<a href="https://<?php echo $row['country']; ?>.curbed.com/2018/12/12/18137948/boston-real-estate-predictions-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Home sales have already begun to slow</a>, and with mortgage rates rising and a new cap on the real estate tax deduction hitting federal returns this quarter, we expect the real estate market for single family homes to&nbsp;<a href="https://<?php echo $row['country']; ?>agentmagazine.com/2018/11/30/economists-differ-2019-real-estate-outlook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continue to soften in 2019</a>.</p>
<p>On the bright side, that means rentals will be even more important in the coming year. <?php echo $row['country']; ?> has always been a major market for apartment building development thanks to its <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/millennial-village-answer-to-<?php echo $row['country']; ?>s-housing-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">enormous student population</a> and growing crew of Millennial knowledge industry workers, so new development will continue to cater to these renters —&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.curbed.com/2018/10/10/17959984/real-estate-trends-2019-housing-affordability-investment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavy dose of high-end amenities</a>&nbsp;thrown in to help <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/attract-young-professionals-to-your-condo-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects stand out</a> in a crowded field.</p>
<p><strong>The Upshot:&nbsp;</strong>Developers&nbsp;should find it easier to fill rental properties than single-family homes&nbsp;and may wish to build their 2019 portfolios accordingly.</p>
<h2>Big Projects Are Still in Style</h2>
<p>Despite the rockier economic outlook for small- to mid-sized residential projects, the big guys seem to be well insulated from the ups and downs that worry earth-bound builders. Mega-projects continue to move forward, so expect to see more cranes and&nbsp;traffic cones as things get underway. Among the&nbsp;<a href="https://<?php echo $row['country']; ?>.curbed.com/maps/boston-developments-to-watch-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most anticipated projects</a>&nbsp;are the Fenway Center at Brookline and Comm Ave., three shiny towers around Back Bay Station, the Hub on Causeway (which has been giving Bruins and Celts fans headaches for years), and&nbsp;a top-10 skyscraper at Winthrop Square. Another possibility? A&nbsp;tower built atop South Station, which has been long&nbsp;discussed but has yet to be acted upon.</p>
<p><strong>The Upshot:</strong>&nbsp;Plenty of work in the pipeline to keep <?php echo $row['country']; ?> tradespeople busy, which could soften the blow of a&nbsp;stock market slide&nbsp;for many local families and small businesses.</p>
<h2>Transportation Woes</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that the MBTA is still struggling, and we could be another mega-winter away from a total breakdown (again). Sure, there have been some improvements, but many neighborhoods still have spotty service. Southie, for example, has always been isolated from the T, but now that the neighborhood has gentrified, complaints are reaching a tipping point. One innovative solution? A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/<?php echo $row['country']; ?>/news/2018/03/01/after-criticism-millennium-partners-changed-the.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proposed gondola</a>&nbsp;carrying riders over Summer Street from South Station&nbsp;to the Seaport. Flying through the sky to work is a pretty wacky idea, so we think it&#8217;s unlikely ever to be built. <?php echo $row['country']; ?> isn&#8217;t exactly known for embracing radical new ideas for public projects, but we like the out-of-the-box thinking.</p>
<p><strong>The Upshot:</strong>&nbsp;Building near existing&nbsp;public transportation remains a smart investment, since it&#8217;s a sought-after amenity. Keeping an ear to the ground about&nbsp;<em>proposed</em>&nbsp;public transportation projects could be lucrative for builders willing to invest in nearby development.</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>2018 brought unexpected utility&nbsp;disasters and some&nbsp;ups and downs in the financial markets, but overall the outlook is good for <?php echo $row['country']; ?> developers and builders. Sure, things may slow down, but the foundation for growth has already been laid for upcoming projects. With luck, any slowdown will be brief and minor, so builders can stay focused on what they do best. For 2019, expect to see those cranes in the air for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Galley kitchens are popular in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, especially in the city’s historic brownstones. This is because in many of these homes, space is at a premium, and the galley kitchen is the ideal space-saving design. With three walls and narrow floor space, these kitchen designs let you pack in all the amenities of a larger kitchen, only in a smaller space. If you’re looking for remodeling ideas for your galley kitchen, be sure to check out the following!</p>
<p><strong>1. Rely on Natural Lighting to Make Your Kitchen Feel Larger</strong></p>
<p>Galley kitchens, because of their narrow layouts, have a tendency to feel small and cramped. One way to make these kitchens feel larger is through the use of <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/natural-light-to-your-boston-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">natural lighting</a>. In other words, big windows out into the world enhance your connection to the great outdoors, which makes the space feel more expansive. And, all that natural light pouring in to brighten up the kitchen makes it feel a little bit bigger, too. Definitely opt for large windows over the kitchen sink so that you’ll have a nice view as you work at the sink, and if your galley kitchen has another exterior wall, you may even consider sacrificing a little bit of cabinet space for a couple more windows, just to give the room a bigger, brighter feeling.</p>
<p><strong>2. Make Upgrades to Your Lighting</strong></p>
<p>Does your galley kitchen lack for lighting, or do you have a couple of large light fixtures that overwhelm the small space? If so, this is a quick upgrade you can make that will not only give you more light to work by, but will also help make the kitchen feel a little larger. For ceiling lights, consider recessed can lighting. This is the ideal way to give the entire room a compact yet even light source—no dark spots in some corners and bright spots in other areas. For a little extra light over the kitchen sink or elsewhere, go with simple pendant lights. These are a stylish alternative to heavier chandelier-style fixtures that can make the room feel cramped or cluttered.</p>
<p><strong>3. Go with a Lively Backsplash</strong></p>
<p>If you’re looking for inexpensive ways to spice up your kitchen, what about a new <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/kitchen-remodeling-backsplash-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">backsplash</a>? This is a project that many homeowners can DIY, and compared to a lot of other remodeling ideas, even if you do have to pay a contractor, it won’t be as expensive as some other upgrades that you could do. As far as backsplash ideas go, the sky is the limit. Tile in interesting geometric patterns, bright colors, glossy reflective materials—these are all great ways to add more personality to the room, and in some cases, especially with reflective surfaces, enhance the sense of space, too.</p>
<p><strong>4. Avoid Dark Colors</strong></p>
<p>We’ve talked about how more <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/natural-light-to-your-boston-renovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light makes a kitchen feel bigger</a>, and along with this, so do lighter colors. Dark shades tend to absorb light whereas lighter shades reflect it. To make the kitchen feel bright, airy and spacious, skip the blacks or the dark wood cabinetry and instead go for shades of white, off-white or gray. The same goes for wall colors—keep it bright to make the kitchen feel bigger.</p>
<p><strong>5. Find New Places for Countertop Clutter</strong></p>
<p>The need for more space is definitely a recurring theme in galley kitchens, and another great way to give yourself more space is to get the clutter up off the countertops. There are lots of ways to go about this. For instance, instead of chopping blocks and utensil canisters, consider <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/6-must-have-kitchen-cabinet-organizers-and-accessories-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pull-out cabinets or drawers with specialized inserts</a> designed to hold knives and larger utensils. You can also install small shelves between the counters and upper cabinets if you need places to put spices, recipe books, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>6. Place Your Appliances Wisely</strong></p>
<p>Since space is at a premium in galley kitchens,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elledecor.com/design-decorate/room-ideas/tips/g3094/galley-kitchen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appliance placement</a>&nbsp;is key—particularly if you expect that two people will be using the kitchen at the same time. The best way to organize your appliances is to keep them all on one wall. Make sure that the stove is in the center of that wall so that you have plenty of counter space to either side. The dishwasher goes between the stove and the sink at the end of the room, and you should place the refrigerator at the end of the counter, along the same wall as the stove. This will make it easier for you to navigate between sink, dishwasher, stove and fridge, and it also leaves the counter space on the opposite wall completely open for the prep work you’ll be doing as you cook.</p>
<p><strong>7. Make Use of the Space Above and Below Your Cabinets</strong></p>
<p>Just because the kitchen is small, that doesn’t mean you need to skimp on storage options! If you’re planning a major upgrade to your cabinetry, think about all the unused spaces, most notably above and below the cabinets. Below the cabinets, you can <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/6-must-have-kitchen-cabinet-organizers-and-accessories-2/">install toe-kick drawers</a>. These are great places to keep the bigger things, like cutting boards, cookie sheets and baking pans. Above the upper cabinets, you can install smaller cabinets, which are great places to keep your cookbooks or smaller countertop appliances like the toaster or blender.</p>
<p><strong>8. Open Up the Kitchen Through the Dividing Wall</strong></p>
<p>Most galley kitchens have at least one wall that separates them from the rest of the home. You can greatly increase the sense of space within the kitchen and give yourself a view into other areas of the home if you make an opening in that dividing wall. This doesn’t mean you need to get rid of counter space. Rather, simply make an opening between the counter and the ceiling. You’ll still have that essential workspace, and when needed, these little nooks can double as serving spaces, an eat-in island or a bar.</p>
<p><strong>9. Smaller Spaces Make Luxury Surfaces More Affordable</strong></p>
<p>Have you always wanted a beautiful parquet or herringbone wood floor? What about those marble countertops? In a huge kitchen, the cost of these materials can be prohibitive, but smaller galley kitchens make luxury materials much more affordable. The floor is generally only a narrow strip, and if you would like a high-end countertop, you won’t have miles upon miles of counter space plus a large island to contend with. Feel free to consider these options, even if you’re looking at a budget-friendly full kitchen remodel.</p>
<p><strong>10. Go with Glossy Finishes</strong></p>
<p>Gloss finishes have a couple of advantages. They are much easier to clean than matte finishes, which is important in a kitchen where grease and little bits of food will get stuck to walls and cabinet fronts. Additionally, they’re reflective, which throws light around the room. Just like with light colors, glossy finishes make the room feel larger. If you want to add some high-gloss shine, there are several options: the floors, cabinets, countertops and even the walls. Think about finishes carefully and choose gloss for surfaces likely to get dirty, or to help make the kitchen feel bigger.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are lots of ways to make a galley kitchen feel bigger and brighter, and there are plenty of ways to add more personality and storage space, too. Whether you’re doing a quick budget remodel or a full-kitchen makeover, use some of these ideas to make the most of your galley kitchen!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret that <?php echo $row['country']; ?> is facing a serious housing shortage, and in fact, one mayor in the area has <a href="https://www.<?php echo $row['country']; ?>globe.com/business/2018/10/02/citing-housing-emergency-local-mayors-pledge-dramatically-boost-construction/plYlzBr3OoM6W6la3L1zTL/story.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the situation</a> an “emergency.” In some areas of this city, rent and home prices are skyrocketing, making it one of the most expensive places to live in the United States. This has led to a <a href="https://www.bdcnetwork.com/boston-%E2%80%98housing-emergency%E2%80%99-prompts-regional-initiative-new-residential-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coalition of mayors</a> in 15 cities around <?php echo $row['country']; ?> to make a pledge to increase the number of homes built in the area. According to the housing start initiative pledge, these 15 communities are hoping to add 185,000 new homes in just over a decade. A housing increase on this scale is forecasted to be enough to keep up with area job growth and <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s current population boom.</p>
<p><span id="more-2064"></span></p>
<h3><strong><?php echo $row['country']; ?> Housing Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>When you take a look at recent statistics, this number seems incredibly optimistic. Between 2010 and 2018, only 32,500 residential units were granted building permits in these same 15 communities, so these areas are looking to more than quadruple the number of housing units built in roughly the same amount of time.</p>
<p>Further, these cities will have challenges to overcome from the residents already living and working there. For instance, many people are concerned about what an increase in residential units will do to an already clogged traffic situation. In some communities, officials are trying to plan around this to help alleviate these concerns. One possible solution is to build new residential units near existing mass transit hubs, which helps keep cars off the street. In Newton, for instance, officials are hoping to build housing near to existing MBTA stops, which will help make public transit more appealing to new residents.</p>
<p>As more people move into these densely populated areas, people are steadily growing more concerned about the impact to area schools. In the future, developers may very well see contracts for school buildings as the number of school-aged children rises.</p>
<p>And then there is the overall quality of life in these areas, which has some residents worried. Densely populated neighborhoods can be noisy, difficult to navigate, and amenities like grocery stores and entertainment venues may be far enough away as to be inconvenient. This is where stellar neighborhood design will come into play. More and more, new renters and homebuyers are looking for that <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/4-characteristics-millennials-desire-in-a-surban-neighborhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ideal mix of suburban and urban living</a>. The most attractive new housing developments in <?php echo $row['country']; ?> will be those that feature amenities as part of their design, with shopping and entertainment mixed in with new living spaces.</p>
<h3><strong>Build Up, Not Out</strong></h3>
<p>And, of course, space is at a premium in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, which means many new housing developments will need to build up, not out. This means an increase in the number of multifamily units, but here again, officials are facing challenges in the form of <a href="http://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2018/07/23/affordable-housing-boston-rachel-heller-marc-draisen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">zoning laws</a>. In many communities, there are zoning rules against building new multifamily housing units, and in some areas, even single-family homes don’t fit zoning requirements. Earlier this year, legislators proposed a new law that would reduce a city council’s requirement to change zoning laws from a two-thirds vote to a simple majority, instead. Unfortunately, the law didn’t pass through the Massachusetts state legislature, but lawmakers remain hopeful that changes will be made so that communities are able to build new homes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, experts forecast that housing will stay at a premium in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>, with available properties scarce and costs on the rise. However, lawmakers are still working on solutions that will increase housing initiative starts while alleviating concerns about traffic, strained public schools and quality of life. Within the next decade, developers can expect an increase in demand for new residential units throughout the <?php echo $row['country']; ?> area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As more and more people flock to cities, interior noise reduction is becoming a major concern for both builders and buyers. In fact, the EPA now classifies noise as a type of pollution because it can have adverse effects on health, especially where stress and sleep quality are concerned. Anyone who lives near an airport or has a neighbor that likes to mow the yard first thing Saturday morning will agree! Soundproofing is definitely something to consider in <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/noise-reduction-windows-assist-with-sound-control/">high-noise environments</a>, and when it comes to windows, in order to get the most sound reduction for your money, you’ll need to consider the window’s STC rating. Let’s take a look at what this means, and how much difference it will make.</p>
<p><span id="more-2044"></span></p>
<h3>What is an STC Rating?</h3>
<p>The acronym “STC” stands for “sound transmission class.” Originally, this was a method that engineers used to measure sound transfer between <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/your-complete-guide-to-interior-house-trim-styles/">interior walls</a>, but over time, STC became the standard for measuring a window’s ability to reduce sound transfer. To choose windows with the best STC ratings, look for higher ratings, since higher numbers mean better sound reduction.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how these ratings relate to sound reduction, the average single-pane window has a rating of between 18 and 20. Double paned windows can have an STC rating between 28 and 32, and windows with excellent sound reduction can have an STC of 40 or more. Windows with an STC between 45 and 50 will cut between 90% and 95% of exterior noise, earning them the “soundproof” classification.</p>
<h3>How Do Windows with High STC Ratings Work?</h3>
<p>In windows that have higher STC ratings, there are several design features that engineers use to help reduce noise transfer. Air space between the panes is one of these features. Windows with panes that are farther apart transfer less noise from the outside because the extra space makes it more difficult for&nbsp;<span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="soundwaves" data-wsc-lang="en_US">soundwaves</span>&nbsp;to travel through the window. In other words, windows with panes that are closer together are likely to transfer more sound.</p>
<p>Other design considerations that help increase a window’s STC rating are its thickness, particularly the thickness of the glass panes, and any sound-absorbing insulation weather stripping that may be used within the window frame or to seal gaps. In general, thicker, better insulated windows will offer less sound transfer and thus, higher STC ratings. If you want to learn more about the science behind soundproof window design, check out this&nbsp;<a href="https://marvin-architectural.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sound-Reduction-Through-Window-Choices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://marvin-architectural.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sound-Reduction-Through-Window-Choices.pdf">slideshow from Marvin</a>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-2046 size-large aligncenter" src="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/noise-reducing-windows-in-boston-400x600.png" alt="" width="400" height="600"></p>
<h3>Are High STC Windows Worth the Expense?</h3>
<p>Noise pollution is a big concern for buyers, particularly those who are shopping for condos in busy neighborhoods. This means that the more soundproofing a unit has, the more attractive with will be.</p>
<p>How do you decide how much soundproofing you’ll need? One way to settle on an appropriate STC rating for windows is to hire an acoustic professional to determine the STC rating of the condo’s walls. On average, a wall constructed with&nbsp;<span class="scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="2x4s" data-wsc-lang="en_US">2x4s</span>&nbsp;and insulation in a typical stick-built structure will have an STC rating of 36. Going higher than this with your windows won’t offer more sound reduction since the walls will allow some transfer of sound.</p>
<p>And then there is the question of how much sound reduction you will see. If the building features single paned windows, an upgrade to double paned windows with an STC rating around 27 could reduce sound transfer by as much as 40%, which represents a dramatic sound reduction in high-noise environments. In general, upgrading windows by two STC points may not give you a noticeable difference in sound reduction, while upgrades of 10 points could reduce sound transfer by half.</p>
<p>Quiet interiors can be the deciding factor when it comes to home and condo sales in busy neighborhoods. To learn more about how <a href="<?php echo $row['url']; ?>/discover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><?php echo $row['name']; ?> and Marvin windows</a> can help reduce sound in <?php echo $row['country']; ?>’s busiest neighborhoods, check out the video below!</p>
